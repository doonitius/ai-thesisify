       "       'Word segmentation is an important pre-processing step in natural language processing applications, particularly in languages with no demarcation indicators including such as Thai. Dictionary-based segmentation, while simple, does not consider the context of the sentence. This paper proposes an attention-based deep learning approach for Thai word segmentation. With an additional attention mechanism, the model can learn character correlations across the entire sentence without gradient vanishing or gradient explode problems and then tokenize them into word vectors. The goal of this research is to test two different types of attention mechanisms to determine the effectiveness of word tokenization. The visualization of attention for each attention mechanism is also included as an outcome.',\n",
       "       'Loss estimation is considerably significant for network planning processes and plays a main role in bandwid th allocation optimization, network design, guaranteeing quality of service (QoS), etc. According to The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the ALICE O2 computing system has nodes, called First Level Processors (FLPs), which collect particl e interaction data from ALICE detectors and carry out local processing. Log data generated by tasks running on FLPs are sent over a network to the Logstash. The log is then filtered and sent to the Elasticsearch and Kibana for future anomaly detection. Lar ge amounts of log -data traffic from FLPs over this network could lead to packet loss. In this research, we create FLPs in a testbed environment to characterize the log -data traffic generated by tasks in FLPs and fit the data to time -series models and proba bility distributions assuming independent interarrival times. The fitted models are then used to study end -to-end packet loss with input traffic from a large number of FLPs in a network of switches. The simulation results can help predict the number of FLP s and traffic intensity that the network can sustain for different kinds of tasks running on FLPs. Lastly, in order to find the best represented model compared to the real trace result, we performed model verification and took into account the end-to- end packet loss and queue utilization of each task.',\n",

       "       'The financial problem is a challenging task for many investors and researchers. In the last decade, many pieces of research adopted deep learning to build an autonomous trading system. Most researches applied the variance of supervised-learning techniques to forecast the stock prices and to build the trading systems based on the predicted results. Another widely used paradigm is reinforcement learning due to its ability to straightforwardly discover the relation between the market regime with the optimal trading signals. However, it is still unclear how to build risk-averse reinforcement learning to trade in the financial market. Many of previous works combined the moving average of the variance of the returns to the reward function to make the reinforcement learning to be risk-sensitive. Alternatively, this research proposed a novel methodology to build the risk-sensitive reinforcement learning by embedding the risk aversion into the policy rather than combining the risk to the reward function. To this end, this work utilized the categorical reinforcement learning (C51 algorithm) with an action selection method based on the Sharpe ratio to build the risk-averse trading system. The approach name was C21-SR because it used 21-bin categorical reinforcement learning with the Sharpe ratio policy. The empirical results in this work revealed that using the Sharpe ratio policy could gain more wealth than using the profit policy by average. This work also presented the comparative study to examine the effects of the exploration strategy methods and the separated neural network techniques on the performance of our proposed method.',\n",

In this thesis, the one - dimensional quantum random walk is studied. Then, the quantum random walk circuit is implemented. Forest from Rigetti and Qiskit from IBM, which are quantum programming platforms, are explored. Two experiments are conducted. First, the circuits are examined on quantum computer simulators from IBM and Rigetti. The sizes of the circuits are 4, 5, 6, and 7- qubits position state s. For each size, the circuit is constructed with 5 different types of shift operators. The results show that computing wall -time from IBM’s qua ntum computer simulator is significantly lower than Rigetti’s quantum computer simulator for the same size and circuit type. Moreover, on the same circuit type, a positive linear relationship between the computing wall -time and the circuit depth is presented. Second, the same circuit sizes and types from the first experiment were deployed on an actual IBM quantum computer, named ibmq_16_melbourne . However, the returned result is only for the 4- qubit position state. The other sizes of position state s return error due to the capacity of the quantum computer.

Once an optimization function has been defined, Hyperparameter Tuning would sequentially consider many sets of values that define the hyperparameters for the machine learning models and select most optimal set. The process is difficult and time-consuming. As such, Automated Hyperparameter Tuning has been suggested to expedite the process and two well-known traditional parameter optimization methods are grid search and random search. However, these methods are computationally expensive for a large amount of hyperparamters. Furthermore, these methods only sequentially analyze through predefined sets of hyperparameters without the ability to reactively adjust the values toward an optimal solution. In this thesis, the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm was adopted to automatically adjust hyperparameters. ABC is a metaheuristic method based on bee foraging behavior. Execution time, accuracy, F1-score, and accuracy plus F1-score of using ABC were chosen as performance indicators for the comparison of different hyperparameter tuning techniques for different classification algorithms against those from grid search and random search.',\n",

As a result, beehives have been monitored in numerous studies to gather audio data in order to classify the potential status of the beehive. This study demonstrates the technique of a classification model for hissing behavior in Asian cavity-nesting bees, Apis cerana, under different circumstances. The monitoring devices were installed to collect hissing signals related to their defensive behavior. A number of feature extraction techniques in the audio processing were explored, including short-time energy, spectral transformation, Mel filter banks, and Mel spectrograms. Moreover, both the traditional and deep learning-based classification models were tested including the support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, and convolutional neural networks. The best model was selected based on two competing objectives: the minimum number of parameters and 95% baseline accuracy. The results revealed that the one-dimensional neural network trained with the temporal domain spectrogram that consists of 2 hidden layers, 32 nodes for each layer, and a minimum of 3,737 trainable parameters could provide the best accuracy.',\n",

To evaluate the model, the measurement metrics include Precision, Recall, F-measure, Miss detection rate, and False alarm rate.

For each size, the circuit is constructed with 5 different types of shift operators. The results show that computing wall -time from IBM’s qua ntum computer simulator is significantly lower than Rigetti’s quantum computer simulator for the same size and circuit type. Moreover, on the same circuit type, a positive linear relationship between the computing wall -time and the circuit depth is presented.

In this research, we examine how it can be used to estimate computing resources of systems based on historical data in order to make them more efficient. Many researchers have applied machine learning to estimate computing resources. The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) is currently developing a new logging system for A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) detector based on the Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) software stack. Beats, a shipper installed on the First Level Processor nodes, will receive the logged data and transfer it to Logstash, a data preprocessing pipeline. Logstash ingests the data and sends the ingested data to Elasticsearch which is used for search and analytics. The system faces difficult problems when working with large clusters which are hard to estimate. Moreover, in the future, the number of nodes and the number of services in the machine can increase or decrease. Resource estimation was used to estimate and plan the number of resources by using Metricbeat to get the historical computing metrics of machines and by using Logstash to make the system more reliable and adaptable to changes. We applied different machine learning algorithms including Random Forest Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron to create models. The efficiency of these models is measured and compared using the coefficients of determination which are Mean Absolute Error and Mean Square Error.',\n",

The model presented the underlying articulatory target of vowels from speech features, using a deep learning model. The model was trained with a synthetic dataset interpolating from the predefined speakers and vowel configurations provided in a VocalTractLab - a 3D articulatory synthesizer. Proposed data generating methods interpolated articulatory targets and simulated speakers’ vocal tract models. This method was designed to maximize possible speech variations. Post-processing data augmentation, e.g., noise injection and pitch shifting, was applied to the synthetic dataset. The study compared different model architectures, e.g., fully connected model, convolutional model, and recurrent model. The bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural network outperformed other models, having five bidirectional layers with 128 units and 50% dropout in each layer. Recorded speech from 12 native Thai speakers was used to numerically evaluate the model's effectiveness and generalizability. Each recorded utterance contained Thai disyllabic vowel sequences, which was a combination of /a:/, /i:/, /u:/, /e:/, /ɛ:/, /ɯ:/, /ɤ:/, /o:/, and /ɔ:/. Thus, there were 81 utterances per speaker. The proposed model accurately estimated articulatory targets from the recorded Thai vowel utterances. The study further analyzed the model’s estimation, using a vowel identification model. While this model was perfectly identifying ฃ the vowel from a given speech, the estimation result from the acoustic-to-articulatory inversion (AAI) model was not perfect. The result showed that the inversion speech from the estimated target articulatory was accurate, having 82.6% matching between the original recorded speech and the synthetic speech from the AAI model.\",\n",
