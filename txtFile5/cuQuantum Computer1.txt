A design of FPGA framework for quantum computing simulation
â€‹We use FPGA to optimize the simulation of quantum computing in two aspects. 
(a) The if-else state is used in place of tensor product calculation. 
This allows the tensor product of each quantum operator to be generated in a single clock cycle. 
(b) The pre-calculated lookup ROM is used for estimating the sine and cosine values.
 This facilitates the computation of quantum gates that are related to angle. 
To validate our work, we implement our design in VerilogHDL. 
The performance is evaluated using an FPGA simulator. 
The result shows a dramatic improvement in the simulation process comparing to those of simulation on classical computers.
