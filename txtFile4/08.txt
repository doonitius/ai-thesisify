Abstract  
 The number of documents in a dataset available on the Internet is increasing. However, 
the limitation of using textual information derived from documents in data analysis 
requires more computation time and resources as the data grow. An analysis of the 
documents in a dataset can be conducted using other types of features. This thesis 
presented a computational study on documents with references. The analysis chose Thai legal documents as a dataset. The data were collected from an information service system 
of the Supreme Court of Thailand’s website. The study utilized text mining and network 
analysis to gain insight from the corpus. The analysis method included connected component analysis, graph clustering, and induced graphs. The study also built an 
informatio n retrieval system from the network features obtained from the network 
analysis. The evaluation revealed an increase in the performance after incorporating the network features with textual features. This indicated the potential benefit of using 
network fe atures in a real -world information retrieval system.

CHAPTER  1  INTRODUCTION  
 
 
1.1 Statement of Problem  
In the past two decades, the Internet has become an important part of human ’s everyday 
life. A study shows that the number of people that has access to the W orld Wide Web has 
doubled every five years since 2000  [1]. Nowadays, there are over 4 .66 billion active 
Internet users worldwide, which comprises up to 59 .5% of the world population [2]. It is 
also expected that data generated per day is around 2 .2 exbibytes (2.5 million terabytes ) 
[3].  
 
A text doc ument is one category of data on the Internet that has dramatically increased 
with the expansion of the World Wide Web . It is expected that over 400 billion text -based 
communications occur per day, including blog posts, e -mails, instant message services, 
and news articles [4]. Those data can play an important role in addressing some business 
questions . For example,  a company may gather the data that users talk about their 
products or services online and conduct research to identify the potential problem to their 
profit . They can  also conduct marketing research to determine a potential new product 
that could address a current unsolved issue . 
 
A common process to gain insight from textual information is called text mining . This 
consists of a process to retrieve documents, transform  them into a feasible format for 
analytics, and use a natural language processing method to consider their internal 
structure and gather useful information .  
 
However, a particular concern is the gigantic size of the data is slowing down the process 
of tex t mining . This is because  the document needs to be transformed into a specific 
format for each analytical method beforehand . Thus, this step can take an exceptionally 
long period of time to process and /or heavily consumes computational resources . 
 
To overc ome the aforementioned limitation, a study on textual representation for data 
mining tried to extract meaningful information from a document in different aspects . As 
such, different types of documents may require specific ways to be processed . For 
example,  schema rich documents like e -mail, a research paper, or program ’s source code 
require a certain step in the data extraction to parse textual data out of the structure . Some 
documents that have references to other documents may also have relationships betw een 
the documents that are meaningful and can be derived as document features .  
 
There are many forms of documents with references that may be beneficial from 
analyzing the relationship in a corpus . Furthermore, a considerable amount of literature 
has been published on analyzing different types of documents with references . Gasevic 
et al. [5] proposed modeling the structure of research papers in the field of distance 
learning and online courses . One of the research topics in the study was to exam ine the 
network structure of documents through references . The authors were able to capture 
useful information, notably a “citation network ” that was drawn from the citations in the 
papers . Using such network, the authors could obtain the most prominent wo rk as well as 
how it affected other work in the related fields . In addition, the authors analyzed this 2 
 
network in the unit of people to locate the most influential researchers in this field of 
study .  
 
A set of documents can be modeled in a network structure by considering the degree of 
similarity and relationship  between the terms . Stanchev [6] [7] constructed  a network 
structure of a news dataset by using term similarity drawn from WordNet called a 
similarity graph . The study reported higher precision and recall in using k -means 
clustering on the similarity graph than on simple keyword matching . The study sugg ested 
the potential benefits of using a network structure of documents to perform clustering .  
 
In this current study, the researchers investigated one form of the most important 
documents with references in Thai society : legal documents . This type of docu ments has 
references to other documents based on the legal articles involved . For example, when a 
court rules on a case, the judges would have to refer to existing legal articles from the 
code of law  related to the case . This study used the relationship to model a network 
structure and extract insights from the network . 
 
The overall structure of the study took the form of five chapters . Chapter 1 introduces the 
problem, objective, and scope . Chapter 2 stages the literature survey with discuss ion on 
existing studies . Chapter 3 presents the research methodology,  including data collection, 
transformation, network modeling techniques, and evaluation metrics . Chapter 4 presents 
the analysis of the results . Chapter 5 is the detailed conclusion and r ecommendations of 
this study . 
 
 
1.2 Objectives  
1. To study the network and topological structure of Thai legal documents.  
2. To evaluate different methods in the network and topologica l analysis that would 
affect the performance of an information retrieval (IR) system . 
 
1.3 Scopes  
1. Dataset

CHAPTER  2  LITERATURE REVIEW  
 
 
2.1 Related Work  
An effort to make computers understand the meaning of natural language has been made 
since the beginning of the Information Age . In 1957, Chomsky  [9] characterized the 
concept of natural language processing (NLP) by stating that  “To make a computer 
understand natural language, the sentence structure must have been changed.” This 
resulted in the work on na tural language processing in the preceding decades by focusing 
on how to construct a set of grammatical rules that could be used for the transformation 
to natural language sentences . In the 1990s, there was a revolution with the introduction 
of computing i ntelligence with machine learning . As well as the growing volume of text 
data available for analysis, the World Wide Web appeared in a later decade .  
 
At present, it is estimated that over 400 billion text -based communications occur per day  
[4]. With such gigantic size, the system that uti lizes those data must be specifically 
designed to perform a certain task with that data . For example,  to search for a particular 
document, a system called an information retrieval (IR) system is used . This is based on 
building an index of each document on a corpus (text dataset ) and usually incorporates 
pure text features, which often lead to the process being dramatically slowed down for a 
very large corpus .  
 
To overcome those aforementioned drawbacks , a number of studies on acquiring 
information from different aspects of the data have been conducted . This was because 
different types of documents may require a specific way of processing; for example,  a 
document may contain a reference to others, or a d ocument is under an explicit markup; 
such as, web pages  [10].  
 
A remarkable study of accompanying information beyond textual data was the PageRank  
[11]. The study developed an algorithm that incorporated the web page and links to other 
web pages . Figure 2.1 shows the structure of the dataset used in the study. The dataset 
consisted of roughly 150 million web pages and 1.7 billion links. Every page had a certain 
number of links to other pages as well as number of links to that page. The study 
constructed a graph and performed an infinite graph traversal and calculated the 
probability to arrive at ea ch page . That probability was then used to rank the popularity 
of the web page . This study suggested that using information beyond textual data could 
be beneficial in some analyses. As a consequence, this led to a rise in the research about 
using links in the dataset as features in analysis.  
 
 
Figure 2.1  An example of a dataset used in a PageRank calculation  [11].

As for improving the performance of the IR  system, there has been an effort of 
incorporating several machine learning algorithms . van Rijsbergen [12] discussed the 
benefits of using a clustering algorithm to narrow down the search space of the IR system. 
The study discussed that b ecause similar documents were grouped into the same cluster, 
the performance of the IR system was i mproved both in the retrieval performance 
(precision and recall) and runtime.   
 
There is also some evidence that has suggested a document clustering algorithm could 
potentially benefit from the network features . Stanchev [6] [7] constructed a network of 
documents from a news article dataset. The relationship between the documents that 
defined the network in this study was obtained from WordNet, which is a collection of 
all the nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives of the English l anguage that are grouped into 
a set of synonyms. This provided semantic conceptual relationships of the words that 
could be used in modelling similarity. Hence, the network was called a similarity graph. 
The study used k -means clustering to group the docum ents based on the constructed 
similarity graph and simple keyword matching. According to the study, the approach with 
the similarity graph yielded a higher precision and recall compared to keyword matching.  
 
Moreover, Ali and Melton [13] conducted a study that compared a seman tic feature 
learning approach to clustering documents with the graph theory . The study built a 
semantic graph from a collection  of documents and utilized a semantic reduction 
technique to maintain the primary topic and filter out the less important items . The study 
constructed a corpus graph representation of the dataset using a semantic graph from the 
dataset and ontology from Wordnet, and then performed clustering using the Louvain 
community detection algorithm . The results of the study reported that the graph approach 
produced lower entropy in each cluster compared to the latent semantic analysis approach. 
The study further suggested that the utilization of a network analysis algorithm in 
document clustering could possibly be useful.  
 
Additionally, Yoo an d Hu  [14] performed a study on measuring the performance of 
clustering biomedical documents using several text features of a clustering algorithm; 
such as, k -mean s, bisecting k -means and CLUTO ’s vcluster in comparison with the 
proposed Clustering Ontology -enriched Graph Representation . The study reported nearly 
twice an improvement in the performance of using the proposed method compared to a 
traditional method lik e k-means . This study also suggested the benefits of using network 
features in clustering .  
 
There has been very little research about the computational study of Thai legal 
documents . Kowsrihawat and Vateekul [15] study utilized textual info rmation from the 
verdict to build an IR system of a summarized verdict dataset . However, the study tended 
to focus on the textual features in building the IR system. However, the performance of 
the system could possibly be improved if the study utilized ne twork features in the dataset 
as part of the information used in the system.  
 
Previous studies involving document clustering with the accompanying network features 
were also mostly conducted using synthetic network features; for example, a feature from 
Wordnet or term similarity. This could lead to a decrease in the potential performance in 
some cases because synthetic network features could not guarantee a real -world or 
explainable relationship between each document. Moreover, only a few studies used a 
dataset with organic network features. Nevertheless, using this type of network features 6 
 
might improve the performance of the system because it would reflect a real -world 
relationship between the entities.  
 
In this current study, the researchers divided the e xperiments into two parts : 1. Obtaining 
network features from the network analysis, and 2. building an IR system based on those 
features . The technical details of the technique used in each part are presented in the next 
section . 
 
 
2.2 Theory  
 
2.2.1 Text mining  
Zanini and Dhawan [16] gave the definition of text mining a s “A set of statistical and 
computer science techniques specifically developed to analyze text data .” Text mining is 
also a broad definition of a collection of tasks required to achieve an insight from a text 
dataset . This also includes information retriev al, data mining, machine learning, statistics,  
and computational linguistics . In this current study, the researchers utilized the techniques 
in text mining . The following  subsections provide a detailed explanation . 
 
1.  Text Mining Workflow  
A generic process in text mining usually consists of the following steps [17]: 
 
- Collecting text data from the source (s). These are usually available in various 
formats. For example: plain text, document file, or web pages . 
- Preprocessing to remove the anomalies out of the data and transform them into 
an appropriate format for analysis . 
- Analyze the text . The technique involved in this step would be differen t 
according to the goal of the process; for example , using  a cosine similarity to 
find similar documents, or use a machine learning model to create a 
recommendation system . 
- Store the extracted information in the knowledge base for further usage . 
 
 
Figure 2.2 A text mini ng workflow  [17] 
 
The workflow  could be varied according to the task and other unseen limitations . 
 
2.  Information Retrieval System  
According to Manning et  al. [10], an IR system  is “Finding material (usually documents ) 
of an unstructured nature (usually text ) that satisfies an information need  from within 
7 
 
large collections (usually stored on computers).”  In general, an IR system often refers to 
a search engine for a particular dataset; for example,  web pages, books, etc.   
 
In addition, an IR system is designed to analyze, process, and store information sources 
in order to retrieve those that match a user's queries . Hence, the IR system usually consists 
of the following procedures  [18]: 
 
- Indexing:  
The system constructs a metadata or representation about each document 
to use in the search . 
- Query formulation:  
The system creates a query representation of the user ’s input . 
- Searching:  
The system compares the user's query to the existing entity representation 
and returns the result . 
- Feedback:  
Some systems have a feature called relevance feedback. It allows users to 
rate how relevant a result is to their query . The feedback data can then be 
utilized to improve the system's performance in the future . 
 
2.2.2 Natural Language Processing  
Bonaccorso [19] gave a definition of natural language processing as “A collection of 
machine learning techniques that allows the analysis of text documents, enables working 
with their internal structure, and results in word distribution.”  Generally defined, this 
refers to a collection of algorithms and analytical techniques that make a computer 
capable of understanding natural language data. Several natural language processing 
techniques were implemented in this current study . The followin g  subsections provide a 
detailed explanation of each technique . 
 
1.  Representation of Text in Vector Space  
Because most machine learning and analytical methods can only operate on a numeric 
vector space,  text documents must be transformed into a vector representation to enable 
the numeric operation . The mechanism of encoding text documents in a numeric vector 
space is called vectorization, whic h is a vital step toward natural language research  [20].  
 
The simplest and widely adopted technique of vectorization is called a bag -of-words . The 
basic assumption is that context, meaning, and similarity of documents are encoded 
within words, and the order of each single word in a document is unimportant. A common 
pipeline in the bag -of-words consists of the following steps . 
 
- Tokenization:  
Each document is divided into the smallest meaningful units : a word , 
normally called a token .  
- Stopwords removal:  
Some words may  occur frequently and do n ot contribute to useful semantic 
information, so it is a good practice to remove those words . 
 
 
 8 
 
- Normalization:  
Some words may occur in many forms but have the same meaning . In 
some cases. it is better to convert the variation back to the base form to reduce 
the dimensionality of the data . 
- Building a vocabulary table:  
All tokens occurring in the dataset are used in constructing a vocabulary 
table . 
- Vectorize text according to the vocabulary table : 
o Count Vectorizer:  
Repr esenting a token considering how many  times it appears in a 
document . 
o TF-IDF Vectorizer:  
The term frequency -inverse document frequency (TF -IDF) weighs the 
importance of the token by scaling down the weight of common terms 
and emphasizing rare terms that oc cur among multiple documents . 
This is displayed in the following equation.  
 𝑡𝑓∙𝑖𝑑𝑓(𝑑,𝑡)=log⁡(𝑡𝑓𝑑,𝑡)×log𝑁
𝑑𝑓𝑡 (2.1) 
 
Where : 
 tfd,t   indicates the frequency of term t in document d 
 N  indicates  the number of documents in dataset  
 dft  indicates the number of documents that contains term t 
 
Note that in this equation, tfd,t and dft could not be zero, as the 
logarithm of zero and division by zero would be undefined. A common 
approach in mitigating the problem would be to add one to both terms 
to ensure that the logarithm and division by zero would not occur.  
 
In this current study, t he researchers used a Python’s library for Thai natural language 
processing called PyThaiNLP [21] to perform the vectorization process. Tokenization 
was done by using its word tokenizer module with maximum matching algorithms. A 
Thai stopwords was also obtained by the library and used to filter out the noninformative 
token.  
 
To emphasize only imp ortant features, as well as remove possible mistokenized tokens, 
the researchers only considered the tokens with the top 20,000 frequencies occurring in 
the dataset.  Overall, the process of the bag -of-words approach could be visually described 
as shown in  Figure 2.3 .

After the vectorization process, the text documents were in a numeric vector 
representation and could be used in machine learning or other analytical processes . 
 
2.  Cosine Similarity  
Cosine similarity is the measurement of the similarity between two non -zero vectors that 
would utilize the cosine of the angle between them [22]. A cosine ranges from -1 to 1 . 
The value closer to 1 would indicate that the vector is going in the same direction and 
thus similar . The value closer to -1 would indicate that the vector is going in the op posite 
direction, whereas the value closer to 0 would indicate that the vector pair is orthogonal . 
In IR, cosine similarity ranges between 0 and 1 because the term frequencies cannot be 
negative . A cosine similarity can be defined by the following equation . 
 
 
𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝐴⃑,𝐵⃑⃑)=𝐴⃑⋅𝐵⃑⃑
‖𝐴⃑‖‖𝐵⃑⃑‖ (2.2) 
 
Where : 
 𝐴⃑⋅𝐵⃑⃑  indicates Euclidian dot product between vector 𝐴⃑ and 𝐵⃑⃑ 
 ‖𝐴⃑‖  and ‖𝐵⃑⃑‖ indicates the norm of vector 𝐴⃑ and 𝐵⃑⃑ respectively  
 
 
Figure 2.4 shows the example of using cosine similarity in finding similar documents. If 
each document in the collection could be vectorized using the technique discussed in the 
previous section, then a cosine similarity of each pair of documents could be computed 
to determine the similarity between them . If it was necessary to f ind the document that 
was the most similar to document 0. From the calculation, document 1 was the most 
similar because document 0 had the highest similarity score with document 1 (excluding 
self).

(b) Pair wise Cosine similarity  
 
 
By utilizing cosine similarity, the researchers could quantify the similarity between the 
documents and use it as the indicator on retrieving a docume nt that was similar to the 
user’s queries or other documents of interest .

3.  Document Clustering  
According to Manning  et al. [23], clustering is an algorithm that groups a set of documents 
or entities for considering the subsets or clusters, where a cluster is coherent and contains 
similar entities internally and clearly different from other clusters . Clustering is the most  
common form of unsupervised learning tasks . In this current study, the researchers 
incorporated well -known forms of clustering called k -means clustering . 
 
K-means clustering divides data into k groups based on their centroids . A centroid is the 
average va lue of the observations on the vector space in the cluster. K -means clustering 
is an iterative process that can be divided into two steps. The first step is to assign every 
observation to the clusters based on its nearest centroid. The second step is to re compute 
the value of the centroids based on recently assigned observations. The process is repeated 
until it reaches a stable state or the stop condition is met [24]. The algorithm is described 
as follows:  
 
Algorithm 1 : K -means clustering  
Required : set of observation : X, number of clusters : k 
Initialize : a random set of centroids 𝑚1, 𝑚2, 𝑚3, … , 𝑚𝑘 
While : stop condition is not met  
          Assign  each observation X to the cluster of nearest centroid  
          Recalculate  centroids based on mean of observation assigned to each cluster  
Return : Cluster  label for each observation  
 
 
Figure 2. 5 Steps in K -means clustering  with K=2  
(a) Initial dataset  
(b) A randomly assigned centroids in the first iteration  
(c) Centroids  after assign ing/updat ing for several 
iterations  
 
In an ordinary k -means clustering, a stop condition would be often used to avoid further 
computation that would not improve the clustering. The condition would usually involve 
a tolerance limit 𝜀, which would be a small number that would be used to compar e the 
difference in the centroids of two consecutive iterations. If the difference was more than 
the tolerance limit, the computation could proceed to the next iteration. Otherwise, it 
could be stated that the cluster would be converged, and no further com putation would be 
required. In some cases, a stop condition could only be the number of the iteration limit.  
 
In an information retrieval system, adopting document clustering resulted in better 
performance in terms of the runtime and precision /recall . This was because similar 
11 
 
documents could be assigned to the same cluster and tend to be relevant to the user ’s 
queries .   
 
In this study,  the researchers employed k -means clustering on the connectivity matrix of 
the dataset, which described the connection between the entities. As a result, the dataset 
was clustered based on how each entity was connected.  
 
2.2.3 Network Science and Network Analysis  
Barabasi [25] defined a network as “A collection of system ’s components (nodes or 
vertices ) and a direct interaction between them (edges or links ) ” .  According to this 
definition, a complex system that could be represented as a form of interaction between 
the entities could be modeled as a network. For example, a collaboration in academi c 
research , E-mail, phone calls, or links in web pages .  
 
The term “network science” can be broadly defined as a study of networ k representation 
of real -world phenomena that would lead to an insight or predictive  model [26]. In 
general, this would refer to the study of the interaction between the entities in the network 
and how each entity would affect other items. According to Bör ner et al. [27], an approach 
in network science can be divided into two categories: 1. network analysis and 2. network 
modeling. Network analysis aims for the generation of a descriptive model that would 
explain the system, while network modeling focuses o n designing the process model that 
could reproduce and predict the later state of the system.  
 
The researchers used network analysis techniques in this current study. The following 
sections are a detailed description of each technique.  
 
1.  Graph  representation  
A common form of representing interaction between entities is called a graph . An 
arbitrary graph is defined by a pair of sets 𝐺=(𝑉,𝐸) where 𝑉 is non -empty set of entities 
called nodes or vertices and 𝐸 is a set of pairs of nodes called edges or links  [27].  Figure 
2.6 depicted a simple graph . 
 
 
Figure 2.6  A simple graph contains  9 vertices and 12 edges  
 
A graph can be weighted or unweighted . A weighted graph is a graph where the edges 
have been given a numerical weight, which could be used to indicate the importance of 
the link or connection . Moreover, a graph can be either directed or undirected; for 
12 
 
example,  if a particular vertex 𝑖 has a link to vertex 𝑗 but not vice versa . An edge (𝑖,𝑗) 
is called a directed edge and would be represented in a graph as a line with an arrowhead 
that would indicate the direction . In this current study, the researchers modeled the 
network using a weighted undirected graph . 
 
In this study, the researcher  model ed the network using weighted undirected graph . 
 
From a mathematical perspective, it would be more convenient to define a graph using an 
adjacency matrix, which is a square matrix of size 𝑁 that each element 𝑥𝑖𝑗 in the matrix 
would represent the connec tion between the vertices  𝑖 and 𝑗. In a weighted graph 
representation, 𝑥𝑖𝑗 would be the weight of the edge connecting the vertices  𝑖 and 𝑗, 
whereas in an undirected graph, the adjacency matrix would be symmetric (Figure 2 .7).

(b) Adjacency matrix of graph in  (a) 
 
2.  Connected Component  
In an arbitrary undirected graph, a connected component would be the number of maximal 
subgraphs that any pair of vertices could be traversed by a path [28]. A connected 
component analysis would enable a finding of the already existing clusters in the graph 
according to how each vertic es would be connected . Figure 2.8 illustrates a graph with a 
different number of connected components . 
 
 
Figure 2 .8 Simple graph with different number of connected components  
(a) 1 component  
(b) 2 components  
(c) 3 components  
13 
 
In this study , the researchers used a connected component analysis as an initial analysis 
of the dataset. This enabled finding the existing cluster as well as locate the entities that 
were not connected to other entities.  
 
3.  Graph Clustering  
To inspect the hidden components in the graph that could not be obtained using a 
connected component analysis, a graph clustering analysis was employed to study how 
each entity formed a connection in the  graph . In this current study, the researchers used 
two graph clustering methods: 1 . Spectral clustering and 2. Louvain method for 
community detection . A detailed explanation on each method is as follows:  
 
- Spectral Clustering  
This clustering technique is used to identify the clusters in a graph based on 
density . The method applies a spectrum (Eigendecomposition ) to the graph 
Laplacian to perform the dimensionality reduction and use the spectrum to do 
the clustering process [29]. 
 
A graph Laplacian is defined by the subtraction of degree matrix and 
adjacency matrix . 
 
 𝐿=𝐷−𝑊 (2.3) 
 
Where : 
𝐿   indicates a graph Laplacian  
𝐷   indicates a diagonal degree matrix  
𝑊   indicates an adjacency matrix 
 
Eigendecomposition is then applied to the graph Laplacian . The resulting 
eigenvalue is then sorted ascendingly. If the smallest eigenvalue is 0, this 
would reflect that the graph would have one connected component . If not, then 
the graph would have more than one component.  In this study, the researchers 
ensured that the graph that was used in the clustering comprised only one 
component by taking the connected component analysis first. Th is only used 
a certain component in the graph clustering.  
 
The corresponding eigenvector to the smallest eigenvalue would be a constant 
vector . The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue after the first one 
would be the one that spectral clustering wo uld be considered . The first non -
constant eigenvector is called a Fiedler ’s eigenvector . This vector could be 
used to determine the cluster of the data points by looking at the sign of the 
components . The element with a positive value would be in one clust er, and 
the negative value would be in another .  
 
If taking two eigenvectors that corresponded to the two smallest and non -zero 
eigenvalues into consideration, the cluster points would become three clusters. 
The element with both eigenvectors that would be  positive would be in cluster 
one. On the other hand, the element with only one positive value would be in 
cluster two, and the element with both negative values would be in cluster 
three.  From this procedure, the first k eigenvector could be chosen to cluster 14 
 
the data into k clusters according to the value of the element of each 
eigenvector . 
 
In this study, the researchers used the eigenvector that corresponded to the 
non-zero eigenvalue as a feature of k -means clustering . Using this method, the 
vertices could be clustered in the graph to become an arbitrary k cluster based 
on the connection between each vertex.  
 
- Louvain method for community detection  
Blondel et  al . [30] developed an algorithm in an unfolding hi dden community 
in a large network structure called a Louvain method . The algorithm was a 
heuristic method that was based on modularity optimization . The modularity  
of the graph is defined as follows [31]: 
 
𝑄=⁡1
2𝑚∑[𝐴𝑖𝑗−𝑘𝑖𝑘𝑗
2𝑚]𝛿(𝑐𝑖,𝑐𝑗)
𝑖𝑗 (2.4) 
 
Where : 
 𝑄 indicates modularity of network  
 𝐴𝑖𝑗 indicates the edge weight between node 𝑖 and 𝑗 
 𝑘𝑖,⁡𝑘𝑗 indicates sum of the edge ’s weight attached to node 𝑖 and 𝑗   
 𝑚 indicates sum of all edge ’s weight in the graph  
 𝑐𝑖,𝑐𝑗 indicates  cluster or community of  node 𝑖 and 𝑗 respectively  
 𝛿 indicates a function  that yields 1 if 𝑖=𝑗 , 0 otherwise  
 
Modularity is a measure of the strength of in -cluster connections in 
comparison to overall network connections . The value range of modularity 
would be [-0.5, 1] with -0.5 indicating that a graph would be fully connected 
and could not be separated by any cut strategy . The value 1 would indicate 
that the connectivity within a cluster would be significantl y stronger than  
between the clusters .  
 
The Louvain method aimed to optimize this value by first assigning each node 
to its own cluster, then merging into the group of nodes that resulted in the 
greatest improvement in modularity, followed by merging itera tively until no 
such merger that could improve the modularity could occur . 
 
In this study, the researchers chose a graph clustering method that focused on the different 
aspects of the connection. The spectral clustering focused on the connectivity of each 
node, and the Louvain method tried to maximize the modularity.  
 
4.  Induced Graph  
According to Diestel [32], given an arbitrary graph 𝐺=(𝑉,𝐸), an induced graph or 
induced subgraph is a graph composed of a subset of vertices of a graph 𝐺 and edges that 
would have both endpoints in those vertices c alled 𝑆. Any two pairs of vertices in 𝑆 would 
be adjacent in this induced graph if and only if they were adjacent in 𝐺. Figure 2. 9 shows 
example of graph and its induced form.  
 15 
 
 
Figure 2 .9 An example of induced graph  
(a) Original graph  
(b) Induced graph   
 
In Figure 2.9, the original graph consisted of nine vertices. The induced graph of this 
graph was constructed by partially setting the vertices. In this example, the vertices were 
divided into {{𝑎},{𝑏},{ℎ},{𝑐,𝑑,𝑒,𝑔,𝑔,𝑖,𝑗}}. The induced vertex 𝑍 comprised {𝑐,𝑑,𝑒,
𝑔,𝑔,𝑖,𝑗} as well as the edges that had both termini in those vertices. The edges (𝑎,𝑍) 
and (𝑏,𝑍) were from the definition that a vertices pair would be adjacent in th e induced 
graph if they were adjacent in the original graph. In this case, 𝑎 would be adjacent to 𝑍 
because 𝑎 would be adjacent to 𝑓 and 𝑖 in the original graph, as well as 𝑏 would be 
adjacent to 𝑒, thus producing the edge (𝑏,𝑍).  
 
 
In this study , an induced graph was used for analyzing the structure of the cluster from 
the graph clustering process. Each cluster could be induced to a set of vertices that 
represented the clusters. As such, the connectivity of each cluster could be observed as 
wheth er they were fully connected, or there were special relationships between them.  
 
In the next section, we present the methodology and overall process before the analysis . 
As well as performance measuring metrics .

CHAPTER  3  METHODOLOGY  
 
 
This section presents the  method ology of the study, dataset, data preprocessing, and 
performance evaluation metrics . 
 
3.1 Proposed Methodology  
As stated in Section 1.2, the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of different 
methods of the network analysis and build a document retrieval system based on that 
networ k. 
 
As such, an experiment was organized into two parts to meet the intended objective. 
Figure 3.1 displays the proposed methodology.  
 
 
Figure 3 .1 Block diagram of Proposed Methodology  
 
From Figure 3.1, the first part of the study was to collect and prepr ocess the dataset. In 
this part, the data were gathered from the respective sources and transformed into the 
appropriate format for each type of analysis. For the network analysis, the data were 
transformed into an adjacency matrix for the graph representa tion as mentioned in Section 
2.2.3. For the document retrieval system, a text vectorizer was used to transform the data 
into the vector space as stated in Section 2.2.2.  
 
The second part of the study was to perform the analysis on the processed data. The 
analysis method used in this study included a graph analysis and construction of the 
document retrieval system. The results of each analysis were then evaluated using 
evaluation metrics.  
 
 
17 
 
3.2 Dataset  
There were many types of legal documents that could be modeled and analyzed using the 
network analysis . In this current study, the researchers focused on the Supreme Court of 
Thailand’s judgment s. The data were available on an information retrieval service of the 
Supreme Court of Thailand’s website [8], which contained 129,402 records of judgments 
from 1920 -2020. However, for this study, only the data for the period of 2010 -2019, 
which consisted  of 7,090 documents were utilized . The data were obtained by conducting 
a web crawler via Python’s programming  language . Figure  3.2 shows the sample of the 
documents obtained and their information field that were used in the study . 
 
 
Figure 3 .2 A sample of retrieved docum ents and their information field  
 
3.3 Data Preprocessing  
The data used in the study were obtained in a raw text format that consisted of all the 
crawled documents in a single file . Preprocessing was needed to isolate one document 
from the others, as well as separate the information field inside the document . The process 
comprised four steps as follows.  
 
1.  Isolate each documents  
In this step, a raw text result from the crawler was fed into a Python script that separated 
each document and  extracted only the information that would be used in the study of ea ch 
document into a row in a tabular file. Figure 3.3 shows the sample of raw dataset.

The field “Legal Articles ” on the raw dataset was in a combined and shortened format . If 
a legal article came from the same code of law, it woul d be written togethe r under the 
same topic . A transformation was required in order to divide each legal article into the 
proper name for use in the network analysis . Figure 3 .4 (a-c) depicted the process and 
result .

2.  Transform Legal Article field into indicator variable  
In statistics, an indicator variable is a variable with only two possible values that indicates 
the presence or absence of a property in each entry [33]. In this analysis, an indicator 
variable described which legal articles that each judgment was involved. These properties 
could be later used to determine the connection between the common judgments by the 
legal article. In graph analysis, this representation is called an incidence matrix, which 
shows the relationship between the vertices and edges. This matrix could be transformed 
into an adjacency matrix by multiplying its transpose, which  was mainly used in this 
analysis. Figure 3 .5 shows the result of the transformation . 
 
 
Figure 3 .5 Dataset after transformed into indicator variables  
 
3.  Category tagging of documents  
To enables the use of some metrics in the study, each document was assigned with a 
predetermined label called a “category” . In this current study, the category of the 
documents was determined by the types of legal articles involved with the case; for 
example, if the case involved a legal article from the “Civil and Commercial Code ”, its 
category would be annotated as “civil”. 
 
Furthermore, a particular case could involve a legal article from more than one code of 
law; for example, a case may involve an article from  the “Civil and Commercial Code ” 
and “Code of Revenue ” . To address this issue, a “subcategory ” was added to allow a 
document to be in more than one category .  
 
The annotation process was done by running a script that considered the amount of legal 
articles of each type that was involved in the case, and this applied a category tag 
accordingly. Figure 3. 6 shows the sampl e of a dataset with a category.  
20 
 
 
Figure 3 .6 Dataset after tag ging documents with category  
 
4.  Vectorizing Text  
To enable certain analytical methods on the documents, text data were transformed into 
the vector representation . In this study, a cosine similarity was utilized to measure the 
similari ty of a pair of documents . This method required transforming the text into the 
vector space .The study used a TF -IDF Vectorizer as discussed in Section 2.2.2 to 
transform the text data into the vector space . Figure 3. 7 shows a sample of vectorized 
data. 
 
 
Figure 3 .7 A sample of vectorized data  
 
3.4 Exploratory Data Analysis  
In this section, the initial exploratory data analysis is presented to gain some basic insight 
from the data before the in -depth analysis.  
 
The dataset used in this study consi sted of 7,090 judgments, in which each judgment was 
tagged with a legal article involved with the case. In total, there were 5,545 articles 
mentioned. The legal articles came from 225 codes of law, including the Civil and 
Commercial Code, Criminal Code, Re venue Code, and other acts and decrees.  
 
21 
 
An individual judgment may involve one or more legal articles. In this dataset, there were 
up to 21 legal articles referred in a single judgment. The distribution of the number of 
articles were positively skewed wit h an average of 3.16 and median of 3 referred articles. 
Figure 3. 8 shows the distribution of the number of articles referred in a judgment.  
 
 
Figure 3 .8 A distribution of number of legal articles referred  of a judgement  
 
On the other hand, an inspection on each legal article revealed that there were some 
articles that were involved in more than 200 cases. The average cases per article was 4.04, 
and median was one because there were 3,064 articles involved in only one case with the 
top article b eing “Criminal Procedural Code Article 225”. The article involved permitting  
the using of legislation on the procedures and judgment of the Court of Appeal in the 
Supreme Court of Thailand. This was followed by “Criminal Procedural Code Article 
195 Sectio n 2”, which would allow the courts and appellant to refer to the legal article 
that was not raised in previous legal proceedings if and only if the case involved the peace 
and order of the nation, or a procedural code was misapplied. Figure 3. 9 shows the t op 10 
articles that were referred.  
 
 
Figure 3 .9 Number of cases involved an article (top 10)  
 
22 
 
After tagging the judgment with the categories as stated in Section 3.3.3, the number of 
times could be counted where the case mainly involved a certain code of law. The 
inspection showed that the most common category of a case was the “Civil and 
Commercial Code”, which used approximately 42% of the dataset. This was followed by 
the “Criminal Code” (28%), “Acts and Codes on Drugs” (4%), and Revenue Code (2%), 
respectively. The remaining categories consisted of up to 24% of the dataset. Figure 3. 10 
shows the number of the top 20 case categories.  
 
 
Figure 3 .10 A distribution of case categor y (top 20)  
 
On the aspect of the text data, tokenization was performed on the content of each 
judgment and the number of words or tokens that occurred were counted. The results 
showed that a single judgment contained between 26 to 4,256 words with the mean at 306 
and median at 255 words, respectively. Figure 3. 11 shows the distribution of the number 
of words in a judgment.  
 
 
Figure 3 .11 A distribution of number of words in a judgement  
23 
 
3.5 Graph Representation  
As discussed in Section 2.2.3, each entry was defined, as to how it was connected in a 
graph using a common shared property. In this study, the common property was the legal 
article . If a pair of judgments shared a common legal article, thus they were related. Figure 
3.12 shows an example of the judgments of a shared common legal article from the 
Criminal Code Article 328.  
 
 
Figure 3 .12 Judgements that shared common legal article  
 
Hence, the data could be used in the form of an incidence matrix from Section 3.3 to 
construct an adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrix would be constructed based on how 
each entity shared a common legal article. In this study, the construction o f the adjacency 
matrix is defined as follows:  
 
𝐴𝑑𝑗(𝑀)=⁡𝑀∙⁡𝑀𝑇 (3.1) 
 
Where : 
 𝐴𝑑𝑗(𝑀) indicates adjacency matrix constructed from 𝑀 
 𝑀  indicates the initial matrix  
 𝑀𝑇  indicates the transpose of 𝑀 
 
The results were used in the network analysis . Figure 3. 13 depicts the adjacency matrix 
used in the study . 
 
 
Figure 3 .13 Adjacency matrix

3.6 Document Retrieval System  
As mentioned in Section 2 .2.1, a document retrieval system could be built on any corpus 
of the text data . In this study, a document retrieval system was built using different 
approaches, including using the network features obtained from the network and 
topological analysis . The detailed setting on each system is presented in Table 3.1. 
 
Table 3.1 Settings of Document Retrieval System  
 Name  Scheme  
1 Text Features  TF -IDF Vectorizer + Cosine Similarity  
2 Network Connectivity  Network Neighbor  Expansion  
3 Network Clustering + Text Features  In -Cluster + Text Features  
 
In system one, a standard text mining approach was used as discussed in Section 2.2.1, 
which consisted  of representing the text in the vector space using the TF -IDF vectorizer. 
This was followed by using the cosine similarity to precompute the similarity between 
each document.  
 
A network of documents was formed in systems two and three based on h ow each 
document was connected. Then, that network was utilized to find the documents that were 
similar to the one under consideration. In system two, a neighbor expansion strategy was 
employed by obtaining the neighbor of the node of interest. Then, the n eighbors of the 
neighbor were obtained till the number of retrieved documents reached the limit.  
 
For system three, a graph clustering algorithm was performed for the network. Then, all 
the nodes that were in the same cluster as the node were obtained till  achieving the result. 
If the number of retrieved documents was not met, the approach of system one was used 
to fulfill the rest.  
 
The approach in measuring the performance of the system consisted of the process of 
obtaining 100 most related documents from  a randomly selected document and compute 
the performance evaluation metrices. The process was repeated 1,000 times for each 
system, and the average performance score was computed for each system. The average 
score from each system was then used to compare  the performance of each setup. Figure 
3.14 shows the process of calculating the metrics of each setup.  
 
 
Figure 3 .14 Experiment Setup of Document Retrieval System  
 
The concept of this experiment was to measure the performance of the system in 
retrieving documents that were similar to any given document when the features used in 
each system were different. In this study, the similarity was measured by the purity of th e 
25 
 
category of the retrieved documents . The  metrics used in the study was presented in next 
section.  
 
3.7 Performance Evaluation Metrics  
To measure the performance of the different methods of analysis; namely, the graph 
clustering analysis, which could be measured by how relevant each member of a cluster 
was compared to outside the cluster, the following evaluation metrics were used in the 
study to determ ine the performance of each method . 
 
1.  Entropy  
Entropy is a measurement of the information or uncertainty of the possible outcome in a 
random variable using the probability of an independent outcome that could occur  [34] . 
Entropy is defined as follows  
 
𝐻(𝑋)=⁡−∑𝑃𝑥(𝑥𝑖)log𝑏(𝑃𝑥(𝑥𝑖))
𝑖 (3.2) 
 
Where : 
 𝐻(𝑋) indicates entropy of observation X  
 𝑏 indicates numbers of possible outcome  that can be found in X  
 𝑃𝑥(𝑥𝑖) indicates probability of finding a member with outcome  𝑖 in X 
 
This definition of entropy allowed for its use as a measurement of impurity in the data . If 
a group o r cluster consisted of only one possible outcome, the entropy would be zero, 
which would indicate that the group was pure . In contrast, if a group or cluster had more 
than one possible outcome and the chance of finding each outcome was equal, the entropy 
would be 1, and the group would be impure . 
 
For example, if a group of 10 contained eight members with label “A” and two members 
with label “B”, the entropy of this group would be equal to 0.723. On the other hand, if 
the group had six members of “A” and fo ur members of “B”, the entropy would be equal 
to 0.971.  
 
By using this metric, it could be stated that the first setting was purer than the latter.  Figure 
3.15 depicted th is example.  
 
 
Figure 3 .15 An example of using Entropy  in determining purity of group  
(a) A group with 8 members of “A” and 2 members of “B”  
(b) A group with 6 members of “A” and 4 members of “B”  
26 
 
In addition to measuring the clustering algorithm performance, entropy would be used in 
measuring the performance of the document retrieval system as well . 
 
2.  Modularity  
Modularity is a measurement of strength of in -cluster connections compared to the overall 
network connections . Modularity ranges between [-0.5, 1] where -0.5 is when a graph 
would be fully co nnected and could not be separated, and 1 being the connection within 
the cluster would have much more prominence than between the clusters . For any 
undirected graph, modularity was defined as follows [31]. 
 
𝑄=⁡1
2𝑚∑[𝐴𝑖𝑗−𝑘𝑖𝑘𝑗
2𝑚]𝛿(𝑐𝑖,𝑐𝑗)
𝑖𝑗 (2.4) 
 
 
Where :

be clearly observed that the connection within cluster one ( {𝑏,ℎ:2}) was not significan tly 
stronger than the connection between the clusters ( {𝑎,𝑏:2},{𝑎,ℎ:1},{𝑏,𝑒:1}). In 
contrast, Figure 3.16 (b) shows the clustering that yielded a stronger in -cluster connection 
compared to between the clusters connection ( {𝑑,𝑓:0.5}).

CHAPTER  4  RESULTS  
 
 
In this section, the results of the stud y are presented, including the interpretation and 
detailed explanation on each method of analysis .  
 
4.1 Network Analysis Result  
Using techniques in network and topological analysis as discussed in Section 2 .2 .3, the 
results of the study were as follows . 
 
1.  Connected component analysis  
After obtaining the adjacency matrix from Section 3 .5, the network c ould be visualized  
using a Python ’s library called NetworkX  [35] . Figure 4.1 shows the overall network 
topology of the dataset . 
 
 
            Figure 4.1 Network structure of the dataset  
 
From the topology, a densely connected cluster was observed in the middle of 
the network, while on the outskirts of the graph, a small number of nodes were 
isolated or only loosely connected . The inspection showed that this network 
consisted of 355 connected components . However, 94 % (6,670 of 7,090 ) of the 
nodes were in a single component, henceforth referred to as the main component . 
Nevertheless, 6 %  ( 420 of 7,090 ) of the nodes that were not in the main 
component were loosely connected or isolated . Figure 4.2 shows the distribution 
of the number of nodes in each component . 
 
28 
 
 
Figure 4.2 Distribution of number of nodes on each component  
 
From Figure 4.2, it could be observed that only 13 %  (47 of 355 ) of the components 
contained more than one node, while the remaining components only con sisted of a single 
node . This indicated that some legal articles had no relationship with other items through 
a common court judgment . 
 
The inspection also showed that the outlying components were an extremely specific 
case; for example, the judgment on the case about pensions for retired government 
officers, which occurred only once across the dataset and had no relationship to the other 
cases . Figure 4.3 shows an example of such components.

(b) Component with  Civil and Commercial Code article 531 (2)  
(c) Component with  Revenue Code article 79/5 (2)

According to the findings, the study mainly considered the main component in the further 
analysis . Figure 4.4 shows the main component, which contained 6,670 nodes that were 
linked with 383,098 edges .

2.  Graph clustering  
The graph clustering algorithm was used to find hidden clusters of documents based on 
how they were referenced in the network . As discussed in Section 2 .2.3, the algorithm 
used in this study consisted of spectral clustering and the Louvain method . 
 
- Spectral Clustering  
In the spectral clustering process, first the graph Laplacian would be computed by 
subtracting the degree matrix with the adjacency matrix. From there, it would be 
possible to obtain the spec trum of a graph Laplacian by using Eigendecomposition. 
The result eigenvector and eigenvalue were used in the later analysis.  
 
To determine an appropriate number of clusters in spectral clustering, the 
differences between each eigenvalue after being sorted  ascendingly were taken into 
consideration. This is called a spectral gap. The position of the biggest spectral gap 
would be the number of clusters. Figure 4.5 shows the position and value of the 
eigenvalue from the decomposition.  
 
 
Figure 4.5 Eigenvalue  
30 
 
Figure 4.5 reveals that the greatest spectral gap was at positions 6,669 -6,670. This 
indicated that each member belonged to its own cluster, which provided no useful 
information for the study. From the findings, a truncation approach was utilize d to 
only analyze the top N positions of the eigenvalues. The first 100 eigenvalues are 
shown in Figure 4.6. 
 
 
Figure 4.6 First 100 Eigenvalue s 
 
Figure 4.6 shows that the greatest spectral gap occurred at positions 3, 6, 15, and 
35. These numbers were then used as the number of clusters in a simple clustering 
algorithm; such as, k -means . In this study, two methods were used for selecting the 
features for the  clustering algorithm . The first method used only the first k 
eigenvectors as a feature . Figure 4.7 depicts the outcome of the k -means clustering 
in terms of the cluster member distribution .

eigenvectors as a feature with K -means at different k. 
(a) K=3 
(b) K=6 
(c) K=15 
(d) K=35 
 
The result from clustering with a stated approach yielded an unsatisfactory result . 
The presence of an over dominated cluster could be observed, which the cluster 
took over 98% of the nodes leaving other clusters with only a few tens of nodes . 
31 
 
 
The second approach used all the eigenvectors as a feature for the clustering 
algorithm . Figure 4.8 shows the clustering result of such process .

eigenvectors as a feature with K -means at different k 
(a) K=3 
(b) K=6 
(c) K=15 
(d) K=35 
 
From both diagrams, the over dominated cluster could be observed even though the 
effect of such cluster was lessened in the second approach . This was due to the 
behavior of the spectral clustering algorithm  which will be discussed in later 
section . 
 
- Louvain method for community detection  
As discussed in Section 2 .2.3, the Louvain method tried to cluster the graph in 
which the modularity was optimized . This study used a Python ’s community 
detection library called python -louvain [36]. The algorithm discovered 13 
communities . Each communities’  member distribution was depicted in Figure 4.9. 
 
 
Figure 4.9 Cluster member distribution from Louvain method  
32 
 
From Figure 4.9, it could be observed that there was more balance in the cluster 
member distribution compared to the initial spectral clustering  although  the cluster 
with only a few members was still present . 
 
3.  Cluster Interpretation in Computational Aspect  
In this topic, an interpretation of the cluster obtained from Section 4 .2 in the aspect of 
topology, connectivity, and purity was presented .  
 
- Cluster indu ction  
In Figure 4.10, each node was colorized on the graph based on the cluster to which 
it belonged using the visualization of the main cluster .

(a) Spectral Clustering K =3 
(b) Spectral Clustering K =6 
(c) Spectral Clustering K =15 
(d) Spectral Clustering K =35 
(e) Louvain method  
 
To visualize the connection between the clusters, each cluster was induced into a 
single node. Figure 4.11 depicted the results .

(a) Spectral Clustering K =3 
(b) Spectral Clustering K =6 
(c) Spectral Clustering K =15 
(d) Spectral Clustering K =35 
(e) Louvain method  
 
From Figure 4.11, a dense to fully connected graph was observed for spectral 
clustering . This suggested that some clusters may have been impure and 
inseparable . In the Louvain method, some clusters were only connected to a few 
neighbor clusters . In addition, some clusters served as network hubs; as such, this 
indicated the possibility of separation . 
 
- Cluster purity and modularity  
As discussed in Section 3 .6, the purity of a cluster obtained from each algorithm 
was measured using entropy . In addition, modularity was used to assess the strength 
of the cluster's c onnections . Table 4.1 displays the outcome . 
 
Table 4 .1 Clustering metrics  
Measure  Algorithm  
Spectral 
K=3 Spectral 
K=6 Spectral 
K=15  Spectral 
K=35  Louvain  
Number of clusters  3 6 15 35 13 
Average entropy  0.503 0.530 0.542 0.612 0.456 
Modularity  0.062 0.108 0.089 0.087 0.569 
 
According to Table 4.1, the Louvain method had the best performance  in terms of 
document category differentiation, as well as structural strength optimization . This 
suggested that using the Louvain method with this dataset in the further analysis of 
integrating it with the document retrieval system would provide benefits to the 
system more than using spectral clustering . 
34 
 
4.  Cluster Interpretation in Legal Aspect  
Apart from the interpretation in the computational aspect, an interpretation in the legal 
aspect allowed the inspection to have c onsistency of each cluster in terms of the legal 
document category, as well as to define the “topic” of each cluster. This interpretation 
was based on the cluster obtained from the Louvain method. In each cluster, the number 
of cluster members and a fracti on of the top three legal article categories were provided.  
 
- Cluster 0  
Members: 1762  
Dominant Category: Civil and Commercial Code (0.68), Bankruptcy Act (0.07), 
Arbitration  Act (0.03)  
This cluster comprised the common Civil and Commercial cases, which 
often occurred in Thailand, such as, the verdict on a contract, marriage, property, 
and inheritance. This cluster could be interpreted as the representation of “popular” 
Civil and Commercial cases that often occurred in Thailand .

The cluster was composed of mainly Civil and Commercial cases 
comparable to cluster 0. However, the case in this cluster contained a mixture of 
more complex codes of law; such as, the Act on the Labor Court, Land and 
Settlement Code, and others.

4.2 Integration with Document Retrieval System  
After acquiring the network information for a corpus from the previous section , this  
information could  be used to create a document retrieval system . As discussed in Section 
3.5, three  document retrieval systems were built:  one based on the text features and two 
network -based systems . 
 
An entropy metric, as stated in  Section 3.6.1, was utilized to assess the performance . 
One thousand documents were select ed at random from the corpus and each system was 
used to find the 100 most similar documents to the one that was selected . Then , the 
entropy for each result set was compute d based on the category to which it belonged . 
For system three , the cluster features we re incorporate d from the Louvain method . The 
40 
 
experiment was conducted on a personal computer with the following specifications: 
AMD Ryzen 5 5600X CPU, 32 GB DDR4 Ram . The results are  presented in Table 4 .2. 
 
Table 4.2 Document Retrieval System Metrics  
ID Name  Entropy   
Average  std. Runtime (s) 
1 Text Features  0 .526 0 .077 5 .13 
2 Network Connectivity  0 .492 0 .073 7 .26 
3 Network Clustering + Text Features  0 .472 0 .091 9 .09 
 
As a result of incorporating the network features into the document retrieval system, an 
increase in the performance of retrieving a document that was in the same category of the 
initial document  could be observed.  However, this came  at the cost of additional 
computation time . This also confirmed  the expected benefits in Section 1.4 that using 
network features in a document retrieval system would improv e the performance of the 
system . 
 
In the next section, we present a  conclusion of the study,  discussion on the result as well 
as a suggestion that may benefits future works .

CHAPTER  5  CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION  
 
 
5.1 Conclusion  
This study focused on analyzing the topological structure of the Supreme Court of 
Thailand’s judgment dataset, as well as evaluated the effects of using different meth ods 
of analysis to investigate the performance of the information retrieval (IR) system. The 
study acquired the dataset from the source and preprocessed it into a suitable format for 
each type of analysis. Then, an IR system was constructed using different  features, 
including text features and network features from multiple approaches. The performance 
of the system was then measured and compared to find the most effective settings 
according to the study.  
 
From the study, the performance improvement in the d ocument retrieval system after 
integrating document clustering and network features  was observed. The results 
concurred with a previous study on the topic. This study also confirmed that using organic 
network features that were already present in the datas et were also capable of improving 
the performance similar to a previous study on synthetic network features.  
 
5.2 Discussion  
In this study, two different graph clustering algorithms that were spectral clustering and 
the Louvain method were examined . The results, however, yielded a dissimilarity in both 
considered m etrics (entropy and modularity ). From the cluster induction analysis, it could 
be inferred that spectral clustering was not suitable with a densely connected graph . This 
was because this network consisted of 6,670 nodes, but the average shortest path lengt h 
was only 2 .97. Additionally, the network's median degree of connectivity was 50 . This 
signified that 50% of the node's neighbors were 50 or more . As a result, this network was 
densely connected .  
 
 
Figure 5.1 A degree distribution of node in the network  
 
Another topic was the behavior of spectral clustering. It was observed that clustering 
always yielded an over dominated cluster when using a lower k as pictured in Figure 4.7 
and 4.8. This was the result of the behavior of spectral clustering called  minimal cut that 
42 
 
in some cases resulted in a non -optimal solution . Figure 5.3 illustrates the comparison of 
using spectral clustering and the Louvain method on a simple graph . 
 
 
Figure 5.2 A comparison of different graph clustering method s 
(a) Original graph  
(b) Spectral Clustering with K =2 
(c) Louvain method  
 
From Figure 5.3, it could be seen that spectral  clustering chose  to cut the edges  
ab(2), ae(1) and af(4) rather than cut ae(1), be(3) and bc(1), which had less total 
weight . On the other hand, the  Louvain method was not affected by this behavior 
because it used modularity optimization . 
 
There was also a study that raised a concern about the performance of the 
Louvain method. Traag  et al. [37] discussed that the Louvain method could yield 
badly connected or in the worst case, disconnected communities. The study also 
proposed an algorith m that could address this problem called the Leiden method, 
which ascribed that it had better performance in both uncovering the 
communities and the runtime.  
 
Finally, this study forced the network into an ordinary graph in the representation 
of each judgm ent in the dataset . In a real -world setting, however, each legal 
article could  function as a "hyperedge ” by connecting more than two nodes . This 
resulted in making a  "hypergraph " as the suitable representation of this network . 
A hypergraph analysis could thus be a viable method for extracting information 
from this corpus . 
 
 
 
Figure 5.3 An example of Hypergraph with 11 vertices and 5 edges . A hyperedges (e.g. 
𝑒1, 𝑒2) connects to more than 2 vertices . [38] 
43 
 
5.3 Suggestion and Future Works  
Potential research  that could  be developed  from this study could include  a comparison 
with other graph clustering methods  to investigate the behavior and performance of 
different algorithm s in document clustering . A comparison could also  be extended to 
compare a graph -based approach with text feature -based clustering to examine the effect 
of using different technique s of fea ture extraction . 
 
As described in the work, this study modeled the network structure by using court 
judgment s-court judgment relationship through referenced legal articles . This was 
undertaken by taking different aspects , so the dataset could  be modeled in to a legal article -
legal article relationship through the court judgment s. This e nable d an inspection of the 
connection between legal articles that were  co-referenced within the court judgment s. 
 
Ultimately, one could take  an approach from a hypergraph  to analyze the network and 
topological structure of this dataset , as the hypergraph maybe more suitable in its 
representation according to the legal article that would act  as a hyperedge . 
 
5.4 Publication

Analytics and Practices (IBDAP) with the title of “On the Network and Topological 
Analyses of Legal Document s using Text Mining Approach”. Full manuscript can be
