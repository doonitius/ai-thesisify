Abstract  
 
In recent studies, many NLP tasks could gain better performance by applying the word 
embedding as the representation of words. In this research , we propose Deep Word -Topic 
Latent Dirichlet  Allocation  (DWT -LDA), a ne w process for training LDA with word  
embedding. DWT -LDA  augment s the samp ling process of an original LDA by 
incorporating  word embedding  technique  to allow the model to capture topics based  
embedding.  A neural network is applied  to the Collapsed Gibbs Sampling process as 
another choice for  word topic assignment.  A dataset crawled from Panti p.com  and 
Amazon Customer Review . To quantitatively evaluate our model, the  topic coherence 
framework , topic diversity , and topic quality  were  used to compare between  our approach 
and LDA.  The experimental result on both Thai and English dataset indicate  that DWT -
LDA  performs better than LDA on both datasets.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODU CTION  
  
 
1.1 Statement of Problem   
With  the massive amount of data  existing nowadays , relying on human to read and 
understand all documents  in order to comprehend all the minutes details in everyday life 
has become difficult, if not impossible . Finding a way to  systematically  extract 
information from the textual  data to help identify important information thus become 
crucial.   
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a research area which focus on analyzing human 
languages to understand the underlying information . With the growth of web technology, 
it makes social network, blog and discussing forum become a casual in our daily life . 
Most online popular platforms give no boundary to people to express their thought, ideas, 
and knowledge that understanding these data is a valuable sou rce of information.  As of 
2018, there was a report stated that 90 percent of data in the world was generated within 
the last 2 year [1]. To imagine the fast pace of data, the report also showed that 456,000 
tweets and 510, 000 Facebook comment s were posted every minutes.  As data grow faster, 
more data  are generated that NLP will become important in data analytics .  
Topic modeling is one of the challenging tasks  in NLP  that focus es on processing 
unstructured t ext data to automatically cluster similar document together  and identify 
important word clusters known as topics . One of the most successful topic modeling 
algorithms  is Latent Di richlet Allocation (LDA)  [2]. LDA  is a generative model that 
learns the representation of documents from frequencies of each word used in that 
document using the Bag -of-Word representation. It treats one word apart from each other , 
although some of them may closely rela ted or be a synonym. So, the shortcoming of LDA 
is that it  discard s the semantic information of words.  Therefore, finding a technique which 
utilizes word -level information to apply with LDA may improve its performance.   
After an efficient word embedding technique was proposed by Mokolov et al. in 2013  
[3], Skip-gram with negative sampling becomes a powerful word representation that uses 
less training time and able to embe d the semantic and syntactic information of words into 
embedding space [4]. This technique then has been successfully applied to various NLP 2 
 
applications [5-7]. Thus, it is logical to test whether the incorporation of word embedding 
could improve the effectiveness of topic modeling or not.   
This study  aims to  combin e the original topic modeling with the word embedding 
technique to improve the topic modeling algorithm . A hybrid approach for training a 
Collapsed Gibbs Sampling based LDA with a neural network was tested . To compare the 
performance of our method and the original LDA, w e conduct ed an experiment on two 
datasets, a text corpus from Pantip .com  as a Thai dataset, and Amazon Customer Reviews 
as an English dataset  [8]. To qualitatively compare the result,  topic coherence, topic 
diversity and topic quality  were used  for the evaluation . 
This thesis is organized as follow: Section 1 introduces the thesis objectives and problem 
statement. Section 2 presents  the related works along with the d iscussion and literature 
review on the  algorithms involved in this thesis, Section 3 describes our datasets, data 
preparation process, our modified algorithms  including the experimental design , and the 
metrics used for evaluation , Section 4 presents the ex perimental results, and Section 5 is 
the discussion of this research and conclude the experiments of this research . 
 
1.2 Objectives  
1. To study on the feasibility of improving Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm  with 
word  embedding . 
2. To study on the feasibility of applying Topic Modeling on  Thai language . 
 
1.3 Scopes    
1. The experiment will be conducted based on 2 languages which are Thai and English  
dataset. 1) The Thai dataset will be collected from www.pantip.com  which is a Thai-
language based  online  discussion forum . We crawled the first thread of posts across 
all forums  in total of 58,304 posts . 2) The English dataset is sampled from  Amazon 
Customer Review dataset  [8] which consist of customer reviews on their purchased 
products  which categories are beauty, clothing shoes and jewelry, grocery and 
gourmet fo od, sports and outdoor, and video games  in total of 77,749 reviews.  
2. Experiment on  improving the topic model by adding new features into the modified 
algorithm . 3 
 
3. Qualitatively compare the result on three metrics which are topic coherence, topic 
diversity, and topic quality.  
4. Use Latent Dirichlet Allocation as a baseline model for evaluation.  
 
   
 
CHAPTER 2  LITERATURE REVIEW AND THEORY  
 
 
2.1 Related Work   
A brief history of topic modeling technique [9, 10]  started from Latent Semantic Indexing  
(LSI) [11], it was proposed  by Deerwester  et al. in 1990. With LS I, a document assumed 
to be a mixture of latent topics, which  was derived from the frequen cy of words used  in 
the document by Singular Value  Decomposition (SVD) . SVD decompose s a document -
term matrix into term-topic, docum ent-topic , and singular value matrix.  The drawback of 
LSI is that it lacks statistical interpretation of the value from the generated matrix.  
A later study in 1999 by Thomas Hofmann , Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis 
(PLSA) [12] was introduced to mitigate LSI statistical vulnera bility  by us ing a statistical 
technique to learn the lower -dimensional representation of documents.  It is a generative 
model in which a topic  is sampled from the topic distribution over its document and word 
is then sampled from the topics.  The graphical model of PLSA is illustrated in Figure 2.1. 
As the probability of a document is a factor , PLSA cannot  handle an unseen document .  
 
Figure 2.1 Graphical model representation of  PLSA  model  [12] 
To mitigate this problem, Latent Dirich let Allocation  (LDA)  [2] is proposed as a 
generalization model of PLSA . Instead  of considering a document as a factor , it uses two 
Dirichlet prior s to model the document -topic and word -topic distribution. This approach 
enables LDA to hand le the unseen data which led it to become a standard approach for 
nowadays topic modeling.  Along with the generations of topic modeling, all mentioned 
technique  only uses Bag -of-Word  as the input of  the model.  
Later in 2013, word embedding was proposed by Mikolov et al.  [3, 4] . Instead of 
representing a word as a one -hot encoding vector, it embedded a word into a lower 
dimension vector. Moreover, it also show ed its success in capturing  the relationship 
5 
 
between words. Therefore, word embedding  starts a new era in Natural Language 
Processing includ ing topic modeling.  
In 2015, Nguyen et al. proposed a latent  feature topic model  (LF-LDA) [5] which  applies 
word embedding  to the topic -word inference process. The process is improved  by creating 
latent features for each topic to be used with  word embedding using  a Bernoulli 
distribution that controls  the sampling process.  The result s howed that their proposed 
algori thm could achieve a higher NMPI score on all datasets.  
In 2017, Yao et al. propose d Word Embedding LDA (WE -LDA) [7]. According to the 
algorithm,  LDA is run as an initializer for discovering topics. Then, the topical words are 
select ed to  generate a must -link knowledge base on their embeddings.  Finally, they 
include the must -link into Gibbs Sampling , to generate  more coherent topics. They run 
their algorithm to compare with multiple algorithm s including LDA  and LF -LDA [5]. 
The result show ed that their approach could generate more coherent topic , compared to 
the other seven models.  
In 2019 , Dieng et al. proposed a  novel Embedded Topic Model  (ETM) [5] that constructs 
the topic  embedding from the word embedding space , and generates  the document topic 
mixture using the variational autoencoder  model. This model allows the word embedding 
to be learned  during the topic modeling training process, and also allows using  a pre -
trained embedding. The experiment show ed that this  model was more robust to stop 
words when using a pre -trained  word embedding compared to training the word 
embedding  during the topic modeling inference process.  
In 2020, Zhang et al. proposed the FastText -based Sentence -LDA (FSL) [13] model , 
which does an augmentation during the sampling process. They pre-compute the distance 
between words with cosine similarity to find the closest word of each word in the 
dictionary . The closest word is used as an alternative word for drawing words from topics. 
The switching between the original and the augmented word is controlled by a Bernoulli 
distribution. According to the literature, their technique could generate higher topic 
coherence among the other two baseline model s. This approach inspires us the feasibil ity 
of not considering a certain word, so we decide to do an experiment with raw word 
embedding . 
According to our survey, there  is a few topic modeling  in Thai language . Asawaroengchai  
et al. [14] experiment on comparing the performance between LDA and Topic N -grams 6 
 
model  (TNG) to investigate the feasibility of handling composite word in Thai.  The 
analysis on perplexity show ed that TNG performs better than LDA.  Another recent 
research in Thai has been done by Pitichotchokphokhin  et al. [15], they compare d the 
performance of Non -negative Matrix Factorization  (NMF) and Latent Dirichlet 
Alloca tion on Thairath dataset with the number of topics from 5 to 35 topics . The result 
show ed that NMF could achieve better performance over LDA. In the aspects of Thai 
topic modeling, we found that there is a research gap on experimenting with topic 
modeling which  is incorporated with word embeddings. Therefore, we conduct this 
research to examine the feasibility of applying word embedding in Thai topic modeling.  
 
2.2 Theory  
2.2.1 Bag-of-Word   
Bag-of-Word  (BoW ) represents  document s using a word -document matrix . It requires a 
finite set of known words called dictionary or vocabulary  set. Each position  of the matrix  
stores the number of times that the word is seen in the document , so the sequence  of words 
are discarded . As shown in Table 2.1 , the word “Program” appears  on Doc 1 and Doc 2 
for 5 and 2 times respectively  while information of preceding and proceeding word are 
unknown .

2.2.2 Latent Dirichlet Allocation   
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative model proposed by Blei et al. [2]. It is 
designed on an assumption that each document contains a mixture of topic, and each topic 
contains a mixture of words  which  defines the possibility of words to be in a topic. Each 
document  𝑀 contains a distribution over 𝑘 topic s as θ with a Dirichlet prior α. Each word 
𝑤 in a document is randomly drawn from each topic ϕ1..𝑘 with a Dirichlet prior β. For 7 
 
the graphical model of LDA, see Figure  2.2. The generative process for a document is as 
follows:  
 For each word 𝑤𝑖𝑗 in document 𝐷𝑗 
1. Draw topic 𝑧𝑖𝑗∼𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑎𝑙 (𝜃𝑗) 
2. Draw word 𝑤𝑖𝑗∼𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑎𝑙 (𝜙𝑧𝑖𝑗)

One of the widely used approximation technique s is Collapsed Gibbs Sampling [16]. 
Instead of inferencing all posterior distributions , it directly samples the topic 𝑧 to the 
observed word 𝑤 to estimate 𝜃 and 𝜙 as shown in Algorithm  2.1. The approximation of 
𝜙 of word 𝑤 and topic 𝑘 is shown in Equation 2.1, 𝜃 of topic 𝑘 of 𝑗𝑡ℎ document is shown 
in Equation 2.2, and the probability of topic to be assigned is shown in Equation 2.3. 
𝜙𝑤𝑘=𝑁𝑤𝑘+𝛽

𝜃𝑘𝑗=𝑁𝑘𝑗+𝛼

2.2.3 Neural Network  
Neural network is inspired by the mammalian brain  which can perform multiple tasks. 
The cell s work in a direction that receive s inputs from dendrites, process es the input s in 
the cell body , and sends the output via synapses as shown in Figure 2.3.  In supervised 
machine learning, a neuron [17] is defined by the connection strength as weights to the 
input s, then aggregate the inputs into one value and ship out to another neuron as 
illustrated in Figure 2.4 
 
Figure 2.3 The schematic image of a neuron.  [18]

Figure 2.4  Schematic diagram of a McCulloch -Pitts neuron.  [18] 
 
Rosenblatt [19]  suggests that the neuron should be connected into layer s as a feed -forward  
neural network . It only process es data from the preceding layer and send s the output to 
the proceeding layer without connection within the same layer. As a single layer, the 
matrix operation of a single layer is defined on Equation 2.4 where ϕ is the activation 
function , x is the inputs from the preceding layer, w is the weights to the specific 
preceding node, and b is the bias . To solve complex problem s, the feed -forward n etwork 
is stacked into multiple layer s which are referred as Multi -Layer s Perceptron as illustrated 
in Figure 2.5. To handle the nonlinear problem, an activation function can be put at the 
output of a neuron which act s as a post -process of data within a neuron. For example, a 
Rectified Linear Unit or ReLU can be used as an on and off switch for the output that 
negative value will be set to 0 while there is no effect on the positive value. To perform 
a classification tas k, a Softmax  activation is used to map the n dimensional output vector 
into probability vector [20]. Each position of the vector represents th e probability of that 
class.  
𝑦=ϕ(𝑧)=ϕ(𝑤𝑇𝑥+𝑏) (2.4)

The key success of a neural network is the ability to automatically learn the input  which 
adapts with errors and adjust the weight into a strong machine learning model. The 
backward propagation process is used to adjust the weight of the input s. Once the 
forwarding path is finished , the actual label of the data is compared with the output and 
compute the loss function and perform the backward propagation to reduce the loss. 
Stochastic gradient descent is one of the basic techniques  do the task. It performs making 
subsets of the training data into batches  for training .

The finding of word embedding by Mikolov et al. in 2003 [3, 4]  is a big step  in Natural 
Language processing. The embedding is learned b y giving nearby word s to predict the 
central word  using feed-forward  Neural Network Language Model  architecture  as shown 
in Figure 2.6 . He also proposes  a Skip -gram model which is trained by a shallow network 
that takes a word as input to predict the context w ord. Both approach es succe ed in 
representing  words in the vector space which capture s the syntactic and semantic word 
relationship from a very large unlabeled text dataset.  
By adopting the negative sampling method on Skip-gram,  the training process of Skip-
gram with negative sampling is to  make a shallow network to distinguish between the 
contexts  word and random sampling. It shows an improvement in the speed of model 
training that performs a logistic regression  instead of a Softmax layer. It also improves 
the quality of the embedding vector s, especially for rare words. Therefore, it has become 
a standard practice for word representation in current research in NLP.

CHAPTER 3  MATERIAL AND METHODOLOGIES  
 
 
3.1 Dataset   
3.1.1 Pantip dataset   
Pantip.com is one of the most popular online discussion boards in Thailand. In the site, 
people are discussing or sharing a  wide range of topics  on Pantip  (e.g., science, finance, 
traveling, loves,  religions, cooking, sports , and dramas). Text data of the posts were 
download  from the first post written by the owner of each thread to ask or to share 
somet hing across all forums . A total of  58,304 posts  were collected, and the data 
preparation process is as follows:  
1. Eliminate HTML tags.  
Raw data of each document  collected from a website is a HTML page. To get 
a plain text, HTML tags need  to be handled to reconstruct the content.  
2. Mask the number s. 
The number s were masked with a special tag <number> to reduce the bias to 
a specific number.  
3. Normalize the character.  
In Thai language, people frequently use the sub -character to easily type 
complex character s that look identical and readable by human s. Although 
those words closely look the same, the sequence of character s is different . 
Detecting these patterns and handl ing them with the correct character can 
reduce the dictionary size and the word is more consistent. For example, 
replacing double เ  ( เ เ )  with แ, and - ํ   and า with - ํ  า . The normalization tool used 
in this research is provided by PyThaiNLP [21]. 
4. Token segmentation . 
Text was segmented into a sequence of tokens . Each token was treated as a 
word for the analysis . In this research, a pre -trained Attacut [22] is used to 
tokenize texts into tokens.    
5. Remove stop words . 
Stop word is an extremely  common word which  less contribute to the meaning 
of a sentence.   To maintain a small set of meaningful vocabulary, stop words 12 
 
was removed from  the vocabulary. In this research, stop word removal is 
based on the list provided in PyThaiNLP [21]. 
6. Remove common words . 
Words , present ed on almost all documents , are expected to be common word. 
To maintain a small set of meaningful vocabulary , filtering out words which 
exist in 90 percent of documents could remov e common words.  
7. Remove rare words . 
Words which hardly exist in document are considered as rare words . To 
maintain a small set of meaningful vocabulary, filtering o ut words which exist 
in fewer 10 documents could remove rare words.  
 
3.1.2 Amazon Customer Review dataset  
Amazon.com is a global e -commerce platform in which customer s may give a  positive or 
negative  review of the product  they bought.  The dataset was published in [8]. We 
randomly sample  20 percent of  the dataset which a document length is greater than 100 
words from various categories including beauty, cloth ing shoes and jewelry, grocery  and 
gourmet food, sports and outdoor, and video games. The data preparation process is as 
follows:  
1. Token segmentation using  
Text was segmented into a sequence of tokens. Each token was treated as a 
word for the analysis. In this research, a tool provided in NLTK [23] was used 
to tokenize texts into tokens.   
2. Lowering the character  
In text processing, vocabulary set is a case -sensitive set. To remain a case-
insensitive vocabulary, all charact ers was converted into lower -case.  
3. Remove stop words  
Stop word is an extremely common word which less contribute to the meaning 
of a sentence.  To maintain a small set of meaningful vocabulary, stop words 
was removed from the vocabulary. In this re search, stop word removal is 
based on the list provided in NLTK [23] and a public list on GitHub  [24]. 
4. Remove common words.  13 
 
Words , present ed on almost all documents , are expected to be common word. 
To maintain a small set of meaningful vocabulary , filtering out words which 
exist in more than  90 percent of documents could remov e common words.  
5. Remove rare words.  
Words which hardly exist in document are considered as rare words . To 
maintain a small set of meaningful vocabulary, filtering out words which exist 
in fewer than 10 documents could rem ove rare words.  
6. Remove unknown words . 
In this research, a pre -trained embedding  was used for English words.  
Therefore, words  which have not been existed  in the pre -trained word 
embeddings  was removed from the vocabulary set .

3.3 Proposed Method  
This research  proposes  a new topic modeling technique  as Deep Word -Topic Latent 
Dirichlet Allocation (DWT -LDA)  which has an  augmentation on the sampling process 
using a neural network.  Our model is designed to allow the LDA to gain  more knowledge 
on words by ap plying  information from word embedding that the sampling process of 
topics is involved  a  neural network which take s word embeddings as the input. The model 
is divided into 2 steps  as follows:  
  
18 
 
1. Initialize  
The first step is a standard LDA using Collapsed Gibbs Sampling method that aims  to 
initialize the topics  as shown in Algorithm  2.1.  For the initialization, this step needs to be 
run until it is converged.  
 
2. Topic Enhancement  
The second step is a modified v ersion of LDA which is designed to enhance the learned 
topic s by applying the knowledge of words from a pre -trained w ord embedding. A neural 
network  as shown in Figure 3.7 was trained on  the topic assignment of each word which 
is placed on the sampling  process of topic 𝑃(𝑧|𝑤). It is designed to learn the association  
between the  topics from LDA and the contextual information  which the embedding layer 
allows the model to learn the topic  assignment based on the embedding vector of the 
word. Since  similar words are likely to be close to each other on the  embedding space, it 
increases the chance of being predicted  in the same topic that the network input  will be 
closely  similar to each other. To maintain a Dirichlet  prior, 𝛽 is added to the predicted  
probability of the network. A Bernoulli  distribution 𝜆 is added as switching between topic 
assignment  𝑃(𝑧|𝑤) from using φ and neural network to avoid repeatedly  using all of its 
own predictions as the training data for a later iteration. Therefore, the word -topic 
agreement 𝜑𝑤𝑘 on Equation  2.1 of the original LDA is changed to 𝜑̂𝑤𝑘 on Eq uation  3.2. 
Hence, the conditional probability on Equation 2.3 is changed to Equation 3.3 and the 
Collapsed Gibbs Sampling for LDA is change d to Algorithm 3.1.

Algorithm 3.1  The modified Collapsed Gibbs Sampling for topic enhancement process  
 
 
To run the topic enhancement process , the neural network needs to be initialized with the 
learned word -topic assignment from the first step for some iterations . In this research , it 
is empirically set to 20 iterations. After the network is initialized , each iteration of the 
training procedure  is done by running an iteration of modified Collapsed Gibbs Sampling 
as Equation 3.3. After each iteration,  the neural network is trained for several epoch s with 
the topic assignment tracking from the modified algorithm.  The whole training proced ure 
is illustrated in Figure 3.8.

3.4 Experimental Design  
The experiment  of our model is designed according to our training phase . We choose the 
LDA as a baseline model to compare with DWT -LDA . Since our initial phase is an 
original LDA, so  we make a copy of learned model from the initial phase to continue 
training LDA to compare with the topic enhance ment  process  as illustrated in Figure 3.9. 
These copies enabl e us to compare the training process with and without our approach  on 
the same topic initialization . 
 
 
Figure 3.9 The eva luation process of o n our approach and the baseline algorithm  
 
To conduct the experiment on both datasets , the training parameter is empirically set to k 
from the ra nge from k = 5 to k = 180 where β,α and λ were set to 1
𝑘,1
𝑘 and 0.6  
respectively . The boundary of word  in Thai language  is unclear  since  we put  words c lose 
21 
 
to each other , the segmentation of word is a challenging task. So, we decide to train the 
Thai embedding ourselves because we can control the tokenization algorithm to use the 
same method throughout this research . We train the  embedding  with the skip-gram model 
on a very large corpus across multiple domains (e.g., Wikipedia, News, constitutional and 
etc.). For the English dataset , we use a pre -trained word embedding on Google News 
Corpus published by Google Open Source.   
 
3.5 Evaluations  
To compare the performance between our approach and the baseline model, two metrics 
were u sed to qualitatively compare the result of our model. One is the  𝐶𝑣 score from the  
topic coherence framework which metric is widely used in evaluating the quality o f topic 
model. Another is a metric called topic diversity which measure s the uniqueness of top 
keywords among topics. As a combination of topic coherence and topic diversity, we use 
another metric  named  topic quality to measure the performance on both metr ics. 
 
 3.5.1 Topic Coherence   
Topic Coherence is a framework for evaluating topic model  proposed by Röder  et al. [25]. 
It define s the evaluation process  in terms of segmentation , probability estimation,  
similarity  estimation , and aggregation  as illustrated in Figure 3.10.  According to the 
literature , the experiment show ed that 𝐶𝑣 score is the most  correlated to human rating . 
Therefore, we use 𝐶𝑣 as a metric in this research.  
 
 
Figure 3.10 An overview of topic coherence framework  [25] 
 
𝐶𝑣 is calculated by segmenting the top word in each topic with one and the full set of its 
topic  denoted as 𝑊′ and 𝑊∗, then calculate the agreement of segmented set within the 
22 
 
sliding window of 110 words  using Boolean sliding window which discard the distance 
of word.  Next, the Normalized Point wise Mutual Information  (NPMI)  and Cosine 
similarity are calculated as  the confirmation measure  against each set . Finally, all 
confirmation measure is aggregated with arithmetic mean as a single value for 𝐶𝑣 score.

𝑃𝑀𝐼=𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑃(𝑊′,𝑊∗) + 𝜖

𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑢⃗ ,𝑤⃗⃗ )=∑𝑢𝑖∙𝑤𝑖|𝑊|
𝑖=1
∥𝑢⃗ ∥2∙∥𝑤⃗⃗ ∥2 (3.7) 
 
 
3.5.2 Topic Diversity  
Topic diversity is a novel metric pr oposed by Dieng et al. [6]. It measure s the uniq ueness  
of top keywords among topics that highly overlapped keywords are considered as bad 
topics . The value close to 1  indicates that the same wor d did not appear across topics  
which reduce s the ambiguity on interpreting the topic. It is computed by the ratio of 
unique keywords and the total top keywords in all topics. In this research, the topic 
diversity is calculated from the top 25 keywords of e ach topic .  
 
3.5.2 Topic Quality  
Topic quality is a measure that combine s the topic coherence score and topic diversity by 
multiplying the topic coherence and topic diversity. It is proposed along with the topic 
diversity by  Dieng et al. [6], 
   
 
CHAPTER 4  EXPERIMANTAL RESULT  
 
 
4.1. Qualitative evaluation  
After the model was trained with the training process as defined in chapter 3, the models 
are evaluated with topic coherence , topic diversity , and topic quality . Table 4.1 and 4.2. 
shows t he qualitative evaluation  of our model compared to the LDA.   
For the  topic coherence  framework , Figure 4.1 shows that DWT -LDA  achieved higher 
𝐶𝑣 score on both Pantip and Amazon Customer Review dataset s than LDA . The topic 
coherence score s were  slightly decrease d with a small variation  upon the increasing 
number of topics . The average difference between our approach  and LDA  was about 0. 15 
on Pantip, and 0. 08 on Amazon dataset . However, the difference between each approach 
was decreasing with the  increasing number of topics.  On average, our method was able 
to yield the  topic coherence score of 0.62 on Pantip dataset  compar ed to the original LDA 
of 0.47, and 0.64 on  Amazon  dataset compared to 0.55.  
For the topic diversity, Figure 4.2 shows that DWT -LDA  archive d higher topic diversity 
score  on both Pantip and Amazon Customer Review dataset s than LDA . The topic 
diversity scores were  gradually decreas ed with a small variation upon the increasing 
number of topics. According to the graph, the difference remain ed stable  that t he average 
difference between our approach  and LDA  was about 0.28 on Pantip, and 0.24 on Amazon 
dataset . The result show ed that our approach clearly outperform ed the existing LDA on 
this metric.  
As a single metric, topi c diversity was considered to combine topic coherence and topic 
diversity.  The result show ed that our approach yield ed higher score in all number of topics 
and on both datasets as illustrated in Figure 4.3.

4.2. Discovered Topics  
Along with the metrics, the learned topics was visually displayed  to investigate the  
learned concept of topics. According to the topic diversity score, we expect ed our method 
to give more specific keywords  to the topics . Some topics from LDA were  more 
ambiguous  while  DWT -LDA  gave  more concrete  topics  where the keywords  were less 
overlapped . The result from Pantip dataset show ed that the word “ ท า” appear ed on six 
topics while it was omitted on DWT -LDA  as shown  in Table  4.3.  Moreover,  the result 
from Amazon Customer Reviews as shown in Table 4.4 also confirm ed the less redundant 
27 
 
keywords . For instance, the word “good” show ed on almost all LDA topics but it did not 
show on the DWT -LDA. This behavior  made the topics easier to interpret from the top 
keywords.

CHAPTER 5  CONCLUSION  
 
 
5.1 Discussion  
 
According to the evaluation , DWT -LDA  could achieve higher score on  all metrics of both 
datasets.  As a result, Table 4.3 and 4.4 showed our model success in generating strong 
keyword to the topics that general keywords were not ranked on the top keyword s. For 
example, the word “ คน” and “ ท  า ”  is less relevant to politics while they were listed on the 
first two strongest keywords of politics compared to “ พ รร ค” and “ สส”  on DWT -LDA. The 
result also show ed that general word on Amazon Customer Review dataset such as 
“good” and “great” were not listed on the top keywords.  
Although our method  was able to improve the original LDA , it highly depends on the 
LDA on the initial stage . The t opic enhancement process learned the topic assignment on 
the first stage. Therefore, there is a possible limitation that this approach may fail to 
enhance the topics when the original LDA does not perform well.  However, this 
possibility  was not show n in our research.  
 
5.2 Conclusion  
 
In this research, we propose d a new algorithm that upgrade the original LDA by adding 
an augmentation to the topic assignment during the inference process. The word 
embeddings allow ed our model to learn the word information from a larger corpus . 
Hence,  the word -topic assignment is done by incorporating with word embedding  to 
assign the topic . In this manner , the model lear ned the topics from the latent information 
of words instead of  considering the close or related word apart  as a completely  different 
vector .  An experiment was done to compare the performance of DWT -LDA  and the 
original method on Thai and English dataset s which were collected from Pantip.com and 
Amazon.com . The experimental result on topic coherence  of Pantip dataset  show ed that 
our model could achieve approximately 0.2 on 𝐶𝑣 score , higher than LDA. However, the 
difference between score s was reduced to 0.1 on higher number of topics  on Pantip dataset 
while it slowly decrease d from 0.12 to 0.07 on Amazon dataset. The topic diversity which 
conside red the ratio of unique ness among top keywords show ed that DWT -LDA  could 
generate approximately  0.35 and 0.31 , higher than LDA on Pantip and Amazon dataset 31 
 
respectively. Finally,  the co mbined score  show ed that our approach could achieve  higher 
topic quality than LDA  on Pantip and Amazon datasets for 0.28 and 0.24 respectively. 
Moreover, the generated topics also show ed that our model could generate more specific 
keywords to topics. So, we can conclude that word embedding not only improve d the 
topic modeling in English language but was also able to improve the Thai topic modeling.  
For future work  of both Thai and English  topic modeling , some experiment s on topic 
modeling with other embedding methods should be investigated  to compare the 
performance of embedding on topic modeling task.
