Abstract  
 
 
This thesis  presents a computational study on the relation between the movement of visual 
facial and acoustic features. Audio -visual corpus on expressive speech production was 
collected for the study. For the corpus, the relevant stimuli consist ed of 4 fac ial 
expression s and 4 Thai sentences, thus in total , there are  16 combinations. Video and 
audio data were captured from 10 native Thai speakers. Each speaker pronounce d the 
sentence of all combinations in the stimuli . In total, there were  160 audi o-visual track s 
for the analysis. Facial features were extracted and tracked by using visual markers 
through the pronunciation. At the same time, acoustic data, particularly the fundamental 
frequency (F0) was tracked and synchronized with the facial data. Computati onal analysis 
on the landmark and dynamic features of both visual and audio data were performed. This 
result provides the relation  of the expressive facial movement together with the acoustic 
adjustments.

gadgets with not just keyboard or mouse but also with touch and voiced command. With 
the increasing computat ional power, computing device  could process high performance  
requirement  program by using small er resources and fast er access with  lots of data in a 
few seconds. Due to that,  the studies about how to create more grateful user interactions 
have been widely of interest to many research and development fields, particularly those 
related to human cognition such as speech, perception, and vision  [1,2,3,5,7 ,8,21,24 ]. 
 
Human uses mul tichannel information in communications . There are a number of studies 
that found links between visual and audio processing [1,2,3,4]. These include both in 
production and perception. In an interactive system, t he system that combin es both audio 
and visual data can thus utilize them to make simpler and more realistic responses [ 5]. 
The audio -visual talking head incorporate s the facial movement, eyes and lip‚Äôs 
movements  [5,6] . The face will be modeled from the set of images of a human‚Äôs face 
features  in synchronous with the  speech  signal . However, the present issue show that 
audio -visual  head talking  is not only the linguistic (dialogic interactions) but also 
paralinguistic (emotions and affects)  [1,5].  
 
Study of emotion expression can help to create a more natural synchronous ity among 
speech sound and visual of facial movement.  As speec h apparatus is parts of human face. 
Human speech may comprise the auditory and the visual modalities. Many researchers 
have emphasized the close connection between them  [3,4,6 ]. A speaker cannot produce 
auditory speech without displaying visual cues such a s lip, head or eyebrow movements. 
[1] 
 
Human speech is produced from  the vibration of the vocal cord and pass through  the 
configuration of the vocal tract that is composed of articulatory organs  [7]; including the 
nasal cavity, tongue, teeth, and lips ‚Äî using of these articulatory organs together with the 
muscles generate s facial expressions. Once a  speaker produces speech , since some of 
these articulators are visible, there is an inherent relationship between the acoustic and 
visible speech on a face .  
  2 
1.1 Problem Statement  
 
Changes in facial expression affects the resulting speech and the meaning of the utterance. 
This thesis  aims to study the relationship between the facial movements and the acoustic 
dynamics, to understand the degree of associations be tween them. Speech wer e recorded 
at the same time as the visual data, in forms of facial markers, are tracked over time. 
Finding relationships between these movements may shed some light toward the effect 
and control of facial features in relation to speec h feature.  
 
1.2 Object ives 
1. To study the relation between facial movement and speech production.  
2. To study the voiced affect by the emotional expression.  
3. To collect the facial movement and speech data of Thai people‚Äôs expression.  
 
1.3  Research Scope s 
1.  A set of expressions was selected to be used as stimuli for the study, including 
happiness, sadness, anger, and neutral (no expression) . Speakers were instructed to 
speakers with these emotions  at the high intensity levels . Neutral expression is 
selected as  a baseline condition.  
2. The expressions are studied based on Thai language. Then the result will be in Thai 
language and showing Thai expressions  based on the Bangkok area.  
3.  The physical facial markers  apply on the participant‚Äôs facial feat ures 29 posi tions on 
face.  
4.  The study on only relationship between facial marker  which revealed the movement 
if facial muscle  and acoustic signals .

1.4 Expected Benefit  
1. The knowledge is generating more naturally emotional expression by synchronization 
between th e synthetic speech and facial features movements. The relationship 
between facial movement and speech production in expressive conditions will help 
the researcher to understand and create the feeling in the human voice. Human spee ch 
with emotion may diffic ult to understand the cause of cultural and individual 
expression of emotion. However, the understanding of feeling in voice and visual will 
help to synthesize more natural emotional speech in the future.  
2. The knowledge is generati ng more naturally emotiona l expression by synchronization 
between the synthetic speech and facial features movements. The relationship 
between facial movement and speech production in expressive conditions will help 
the researcher to understand and create the feeling in the human v oice. Human speech 
with emotion may difficult to understand the cause of cultural and individual 
expression of emotion. However, the understanding of feeling in voice and visual will 
help to synthesize more natural emotional speec h in the future.  
  CHAPTER  2 RELATED WORKS  
 
In this chapter , related work about emotional  speech  synthesis , facial movement  and 
facial expression,  speech  synthesis , and audio and vision emotional speech  are given.  
 
2.1 Speech Production  
The speech production is the p rocess of the motor system using the vocal apparatus to 
articulate the sounds and the operation of the selection of the words and organize the 
grammatical form. The speech sound is produce d by the exhaled air from the lungs and 
cause d the vibration of the vocal cord or turbulence some point in the vocal tract. It then 
comes out as the speech sound through the lip and nose. The shape of the vocal tract 
affects the sound in many levels . Vocal tract can be simply separated into two parts: oral 
and nasal tracts . The oral tract comprises the pharynx, palate, tongue, lips, and jaw. The 
nasal tract acts a secondary acoustic radiator.

2.2   Facial Movement and Facial Expression  
Facial Expressions are formed by the movements of facial featur e parts on the human‚Äôs 
facial. The various facial behaviors and motions can be parameterized based on muscle 
actions. This set of parameters can  then be used to represent the various facial 
expressions.  This part gives the related research which worked on facial expression and 
facial movement parameterized, and the current virtual character animation systems.  
 
2.2.1 The related facial expression and facial movement research  
1. Facial Action Coding System (FACS)  
The widely used method to describing facial mo vement based on anatomical basis of 
facial action, named Facial Action Coding System or FACS. Facial Action Coding 
System was used to classify the atomic facial si gnals into Action Units (AUs) through 
analysis of facial muscle contractions [ 9]. As shown in  Figure 2.2, AUs are grouped based 
on their location on the face and the type of facial action involved. The ‚Äúupper -face‚Äù AUs 
include the eyebrows, forehead,  and eyelids muscles, e.g., the inner brow raiser muscle  
corresponds to AU1; the ‚Äúlower -face‚Äù AUs i nclude  muscles around the mouth and lips; 
and the ‚Äúhead and eye  movement‚Äù AUs include the neck muscles which move the  head, 
whereas the eye muscles move the g aze direction.  
 
 
Figure 2. 2 Sample AUs of the FACS  [9] 
6 
Emotional FACS (EmFACS) [ 10] is a subset o f FACS,  focused on facial expressions of 
emotions. EmFACS provides  subsets of AUs used to generate Ekman‚Äôs 6 universal  
emotions  [11]: happiness, sadness, disg ust, surprise, fear, and anger. And other emotional 
facial expressions such as contempt,  pride, an d embarrassment can also be depicted by  
AU combinations.  
 
2. Facial Animation Parameter (FAPs)  
Facial Feature Extraction are using the extracted facial feature points through Active 
Appearance Model (AAM) which represented as Facial Animation Parameter (FA Ps) 
[13][14]. It was start from the issue to facial control parameterization  in the animation 
and graphics researchers were more focused on the facial m ovements that the parameters 
caused, rather  than the efforts to choose the best set of parameters  [13]. Then  the Moving 
Pictures Experts  Group or MPEG introduced the Facial Animation (FA) specifications in 
the MPEG -4 standard.  The MPEG -4 defines a face mod el in its neutral state to have a 
specific set of properties . Key features are exampled  eye separation, iris diameter, etc are 
defined on this neutral face model . The standard also defines 84 key feature points (FPs) 
on the neutral face [ 14]. The n the  move ment of the FPs is used to  understand and 
recognize facial movements (expressions) and in turn also used  to animate the faces. 
Figure 2.3 shows the  location of the 84 FPs on a neutral face as defined by the MPEG -4 
standard.  
 7 
 
 
Figure 2. 3 The 84 Feature Points (FPs) defined on a neutral face  [15] 
 
The FAPs are a set of parameters that represent a complete se t of facial actions along with 
head -motion, tongue,  eye and mouth control . However,  the FAPs like the AUs are closely 
related to muscle action s [14]. According to that, many of research still using FACS as 
the basic method.  
 
2.2.2  The current virtual chara cter animation system  
FACS is widely  used for animating virtual characters‚Äô facial  expressions. The example of 
realistic character modeling su ch as facial animation, speech synthesis, and  various 
automated non -verbal behaviors.  There are some of syste ms ba sed on FACS and FAPs. 
There are FACSGen [1 6], Villagrasa and Sanchez  [17], Alfred  [18], Greta  [19] (based on 
FAPs ), Digital Emily [20], and HapFACS [22] 
 
8 
The meaningful facial feature  positions  from the FACS and FAPs system  are used in many virtual 
character s animation system as the previous paragraph. They are worked together to create the 
good experiences for animating. Most of facial features in FAPs are in the same position and 
represent the action units of FACS.  For example,  the key features  5.3 and 5.4 from FAPs  reveal 
the AU12 in FACS . Some of these positions also selected and operated in many studies of facial 
expression as will show in the topic 2.4.  
 
2.2.3  The facial expression database  
The studies of facial expression, facial movement, and emotiona l expression are 
provided the facia l information from many databases. The present  database which 
inspired how to record and deal with emotion condition dialog plan on this thesis  is the 
database from research journal named the Ryerson Audio -Visual Database  of Emotional 
Speech and Song (RAVD ESS): A dynamic, multimodal set of facial and vocal 
expressions in North American English  [23]. The RAVDESS is a validated multimodal 
database of emotional speech and song .

2.3 Emotional Speech Production  
From the recent research on speech, processing has focused on emotional expression, as 
the expectation of creating naturalness most obviously missing from synthetic speech, 
which is an appropriate emotion to expr ess. Speech reco gnition has focused on what is 
each emotional express in a speech signal. Moreover, speech synthesis has focused on 
how to generate emotional expressiveness in synthesized speech. This observation has 
motivated attempts to combine the expre ssion of emotion s into synthetic speech for more 
than a decade. Furthermore, that attempts increasing in recent years.  
 
The way emotion expressed in speech can improve along two axes. First, the description 
of the voice correlates of emotions (how is a giv en emotion expre ssed in speech). 
Moreover, second is the description of the emotional states themselves (what are the 
properties of the emotional state to be expressed or what is the relation between this 
emotional state and another state) [24].  
 
The expre ssion of emotion  in synthetic speech can found in the literature. A variety of 
approaches has been employed [2]. The modeling of emotion in speech turns to several 
parameters, such as fundamental frequency (F0) level, voice quality, or articulation 
precisi on. There are ex isting techniques, such as Formant synthesis, Diphone 
concatenation, Unit selection, or Prosody rules [2].  
 
From the studied about emotional expression, one of classic research come from 
psychology, which used to divide in dimension and pr edict continuous  emotion in terms 
of Valence and Arousal [25]. Besides, the circumplex model of emotion [25] is the model 
consists of a two -dimensional, circular structure involving the dimensions of valence and 
arousal, as shown in Figure 2.1. Within this  structure, emot ions that are inversely 
correlated placed across the circle from one another.  
 10 
 
 
Figure 2. 5 The 2D valence -arousal emotion space  (The affective emotion terms are only   
  approximated  position ) 
 
Valence and Arousal (V -A) emotional plane su ggests a simple powerful way of 
organizing different emotions in terms of their affect appraisals (valence)  and 
physiological reactions (arousal) . It allows for direct comparison of different emotions 
which used in research  about emotion recognition.  
 
One purpose of the studies about emotion speech synthesis is to create the face -to-face 
communication. Face-to-face communication is in fact much more than speaking and 
speech is greatly influenced both in  substance and content.  Face-to-face communication 
is multimodal ; interacting involves multimodality and nonverbal  communication to a 
large extent.   
 
2.4   Facial Movement  and Speech pro duction  
There are three studies of facial movements and speech producti on, which give the effects 
of the movements on speech sounds. These research  study in a similar purpose, but 
different tracking feature methods. The first research used the OPTOTRAK motion 
captures, which is the wireless markers system to track the head and face movement. The 
second research used the drawing on a face and camera. And th e last one used only the 
computer vision and image processing to extract and keep track of the features.

2.4.1 The audiovisual production of Mandarin tones  
The study of audio -visual production  for Mandarin tones by capturing m otion and using 
PCA for mode lling the face movements [ 6] are studied about the correlations between F0 
values and the different face and head components.  The motion capture captured by 
OPTOTRAK system while a speaker speaking.  PCA used for identifying the important 
visual parameters which related to the different F0 patterns of each tone.  The paper 
presents the visual correlates of tone but different in citation and sentential forms.  
 
2.4.2 The audiovisual production and perception study in French  
The exper iments of  audiovisual production and perception of contrastive focus in French 
[3] suggest that the lower face components correlate  of contrastive audiovisual perception 
in French.  The participants of an experiment give the correct answer, what is the spea ker 
speaks  without the sound, when the speaker speaks in hyper -articulation. The visual cues 
enhance perception. The analysis results of the study showed that poorly perceived 
stimuli corresponded to not clearing visible articulatory and duration.  
 
2.4.3 The facial movements made during Mandarin tone production al ong with pitch 
trajectories  
The visual cues are applied in Mandarin tone production by using computer -vision and 
image processing technique  and analyzed by random forest classifier to understand wh ich 
extract facial features are most representative for each tone [ 4]. The recorded video  
preprocessed by identify specify visual cues which induced by facial movements i n each 
tone production. The study measured the manner and length of the movements usin g 
distance and time as base metrics. The extracted features are analyzed in two parts  to find 
the most relevant features and analyst to examine the individual features on each tone.  
Then the  discrim inant approach, random forest classifier , performed the as sociations 
between features and tone . The study found the linguistic relevance of visual cues has 
significant implications for tone perception.  The tone perception is needed to determine 
how the vis ual tonal cues are used to promote perception of categoric al tonal distinctions 
and extent to which perception is based on linguistic relevance of that cues.

2.5 Thai audio -visual emotional speech analysis  
Many emotion speech corpora which collected video and speech gather the gesture in the 
English language, as the corpus named RADVSS in the previous related works section. 
The EMOLA[3 1] is the Thai emotional speech corpus. The corpus collects the 
professional acting from the actors and actr esses in the Thai drama. And transcription 
from the show with tagged th e emotions of each utterance. The total video clips nearly 
long 16 hours or 940 minutes.  
 
 
 
Figure 2.6  Example screen of Subtitle Edit  [31] 
 
The research corpus aims to classify the emotional states by developing the clearly 
expressed feelings of perform ed actors. First, the data collection assembled the video and 
speech data from the Thai drama series. Second, the selected drama series are extracted 
and subtitled data. T hen annotated the emotion states of each data.  
 
2.6 Speech Synthesis  
Before the revie w of speech synthesis, I will interview about speech -to-speech system. 
The speech -to-speech is a process of speech technologies combination which created to 
do some specia l task. There is speech recognition, recognized what is the meaning of 
speech content , to speech synthesis, generated what is the content in sounded. The 
translation systems focus on the processing of linguistic content, without knowing 
gestures in human f ace-to-face communication (Reviewed in Emotional Expressions).  
13 
 
For example, the spee ch-to-speech translation [2 6] processed the required audio by 
putting it in to the system to captured by a speech recognizer. The linguistic content will 
be extracted  then do the content analysis to be translated into the target language. Finally, 
the spee ch synthesizer takes an input as the representation of the content, transmitting F 0 
contours, and generates the spoken translation. (In this example [2 6] is using some of 
visual contents to help the selecting appropriate synthesis style. It shows part of v isual 
involved in speech processing.)  
 
As the speech -to-speech system is used as a communication tool between humans. Then 
making the natural synthesized speech or having appropriate expression of affect in the 
synthetic speech are important.  
 
To define th e speech synthesis, it generates the speech signal process by using meaning 
in computational for human interactions. The Text -to-Speech (TTS) synthesis is one of 
notably technique, which generates intelligible, natural -sounding artificial speech for a 
given input text. TTS systems mostly have two main parts; there are text analysis and 
speech waveform generation. In the text analysis part is converting the input te xt into a 
linguistic specification consisting of elements such as phonemes. In the speech wave form 
generation part is generating the speech waveforms from the produced linguistic 
specification.  
 
In the waveform‚Äôs generating part are the two primary technologies synthetic speech 
waveform. There are concatenative synthesis and formant synthesis. Acco rding to the 
long studied from the part until now, each technology has strengths and weakness then 
we will use them in the combination of two technologies.  For concatenative synthesis, 
there are three main sub -types; unit selection synthesis, diphone synth esis, and domain -
specific synthesis. The unit selection provides the greatest naturalness [ 1] because it 
applies a small amount of digital signal processin g to the record speech. However, unit 
selection synthetic speech naturalness is required the very lar ge databases. Then we will 
select the proper sounded by using unit selection and modifying the selection to the target 
speech that we need. In this study w ill use the fundamental frequency contours, as found 
in formant synthesis, to transmit the tone, pros ody, energy of the sounded to become the 
closely synthesized speech as it should be. The quantitative target approximation (qTA) 14 
model [4][5][24] will be u sed in this part. The quantitative target approximation model is 
the model to simulate tone and inton ation from the generating F 0 contours, based on the 
target approximation model [2 7] and the PENTA model [2 7]. 
 
Even if text -to-speech systems is a good tec hnique to use in the speech synthesis. 
However, text -to-speech system would need to predict the affec t and emotion from the 
textual input. Then to create the emotion speech synthesized one from many ways is 
applying the process strategies to multimodal inp ut (audio and visual).  
 
2.7 Articulatory Movement Model  
Parallel Encoding and Target Approximation ( PENTA) model is a computational model 
on the functional -acoustical movement relationships that can be used to generate the 
surface F0 contours in syllable synchronized sequential target approximation manner, 
whereby each target is an underlying linear path  specified by multiple communicative 
functions  [27]. PENTA model assumes  that the surface acoustic feature represents both 
the local and global components resulting from implementing the communicative 
functions  [28]. This framework can be adapted to repres ent the effect of facial movements 
by expressing the facial expression a s one of the communicative functions.  
 
 
 
Figure 2. 7 Illustration of PENTA model   
 
In PENTA, a pitch target is a forcing function representing the strong join force of the 
laryngeal mu scles that control vocal fold tension [27]. From Figure 3, the vertical lines 
represent syllable boundaries. The dashed lines represent underlying targets of the unit. 
The thick curve represents the surface of F0 contour that results from the asymptotic 
15 
approximation of the pitch targets  [28]. This study uses the PENTA trainer script based 
on PENTA model to generate the F0 contours from the experiment record s. 
2.8  Audio ‚Äì Visual Synchronous in Talking Head  
The audio and visual integration is important in the multimodal communication, more 
than one interaction is provided. In multimodal communication where human  speech is 
involved, audio -visual interaction is particularly significant because human speech is 
bimodal in nature.  Human speech is produced by the vibration of the vocal cord and the 
configuration of the vocal tract  that is  composed of articulatory organs  [1]; including the 
nasal cavity,  tongue, teeth,  and lips. The u sing of these  articulatory organs together with 
the muscles that generate facial exp ressions . A speaker produces speech. Since  some of 
these articulators are visible, there is an inherent relationship between the acoustic and  
visible  speech  on face . 
 
In the talking head, the speech is synchronized with the movements of facial features on 
the simulated head. Some approach of the methods for synthesis of animated talking 
heads use the basic idea. That is to concatenate pieces of recorded data to produce the 
new data . It is called sample -based talking -head animations . In this research [ 5] sho w the 
method that us e PC A based metric for discriminating fine differences in the appearance 
of facial features . They also use the combination of geometric and pixel -based to 
characterize the appearance of facial parts and use a full 3D head -pose estimatio n to  take 
care for t he different orientations. And use the unit selection process to find the best 
segments. The system overview of this research is divided into two parts: the processing 
to prepare the database and the processing for synthesis . CHAPTER  3 EXPERIMENT AL DESIGN  
  AND DATA COLLECTION  
 
This chapter explains the procedure of dataset creation and the evaluation of the dataset 
and to find  the impact factors is also explained .  
 
3.1 Experimental Design  
The study aims to find the esse ntial relations among the features. The experiments divided 
into three parts:  (1) The data collected visualizing , (2) The audio -visual correlates , and 
(3) The emotion effects as the difference in sound and facial features of each person and 
the emotional e ffects of the same emotion group and across the group . The first 
experiment was the visualization of data collected in the corpus, which separate into facial 
coordination and speech audio to create the visualized graph of the movement of x -y 
coordination a long with F0 contour. The experiment revealed the relation of visual and 
audio change along the timeline. The second experiment was the correlation calculation  
of audio and visual data in a person. The experiment tried to find the relation by 
computing the  cross -correlation of each person's features.  The third experiment was the 
comparison of the correlation of audio -visual data among the different emotions in t he 
same person and across other people. Thai expressive audio -visual data in this studied 
was col lected by recording Thai native speakers explained in section 3.2.  
 
3.2 Data Collection  
3.2.1  Data collection process  
The audio -visual  corpus  was designed to contain the variations of facial expressions and 
speech content. S timuli consist of 4 facial expr ession s and 4 Thai sentences, in total of 
16 combinations.  Ten Thai native speakers (five males and five females) participated in 
data collect ion. Each speaker pronounced the stimuli sentence. In total, there are 160 
emotional expressive utterances and vis ual tracks.  
 
Four emotion categories, including  joy, sadness, anger , and neutral , were used in this 
study . The first t hree emotions  were selected from eight emotions from the different 
arousal levels from each other .  In case of neutral was used as the ba seline condition and 
each expression produce in the high intensity expressive level.  The four emotion states , 17 
which  were used with all speakers and a description of each emotional condition were  
provided.   
 
The recording was physical setup as  shown in  Figure 3.1 . The speaker sat in front of the 
recording equipment during the recoding. A  break -time was provided for speakers  to rest 
and prepare between conditions.  
 
 
 
Figure 3.1  The physical setup of the recording equipment  
 
In each recording, the speaker‚Äôs  face marked by the white stickers on the important facial 
feature points. The critical reason for masking points is helping to track a correctly 
changes position of each facial feature.  
 
From the studies of facial movement research, there are many paramet er sets used to 
represent facial movement. The facial feature positions were selected using the main key 
features commonly found in the facial expression studies from chapters 2.2 and 2.4. The 
essential features rely on the mouth and cheeks. The selected p ositions also used the same 
key features in facial animation technics, for example, in FACSGen, Digital E mily, and 
HapFACS.   
 
Then 29 facial features are selected and  shown in Figur e 3.2. T he color  dots represent 
areas of facial features . There are Blue co lors for  a mouth zone, Orange colors for  a chin 
 
18 
and lower face zone, Green colors for cheek zones, Red co lors for eyes‚Äô corners, and 
Yellow colors for eyebrows‚Äô borders.   
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.2  Illustration of facial feature trackers  
 
The speakers pronounced fou r sentences of ten syllables:  
(1) ‚Äú ‡∏â ‡∏± ‡∏ô‡∏´ ‡∏¥ ‡∏ß ‡∏Ç ‡πâ ‡∏≤ ‡∏ß ‡πÅ‡∏• ‡πâ ‡∏ß ‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏≤ ‡πÑ ‡∏õ‡∏Å ‡∏¥ ‡∏ô‡∏Ç ‡πâ ‡∏≤ ‡∏ß ‡∏Å ‡∏± ‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏ñ ‡∏≠ ‡∏∞‚Äù ( Chan hiw khaw laew rea pi kin khaw kan ther)

The sentences are created for testing the different of facial movements and acoustic 
features.  
 
3.2.2 Computation al process ing 
The computation  process is focused on how emotion , or facial expression,  can affect  
speech  process  to produce the sound . The collected data in a previous process  was used 
as the audio  and visual speech database  separately.  
 
 
19 
The recorded audio s were used for measuring and simulatin g curve of utterance. 
Fundamental frequency  (F0), which produced in the larynx by the vibration of the vocal 
folds,  extracted basically by autocorrelation using Praat  [30], the speech analysis 
software. Then the ProsodyPro script was used  [29] for extracti ng the F0 contours. F0 
curve of each utterance is used to compare with the position of facial movement.  Despite 
of formant frequencies or the acoustic resonance of human vocal tract which measured 
as an amplitude peak in frequency spectrum of the sound sou rce. The first three formant 
frequencies  (F1, F2, F3) extracted by using FormantPro script [3 2] for extracting the F 1, 
F2, F3 contours with the normal time samplings. F1, F2, F3 data of each utterance are 
also used for the facial movement features comparat ion. 
 
The visual data of facial expression  videos  with the tracked features were used for 
measuring the changing pos ition of each features during speaking.  The position data was 
extracted from a video by using Open CV, computer vision library, on Python , then 
normalized the points data in each set before comparing the result with each utterance in 
the fundamental freque ncy and the formant frequencies . 
 
3.3 Evaluation Method  
3.3.1  Collected data evaluation  
The audio -visual data of Thai native speakers colle cted for test the relationship among 
the audio and visual features movement. The data in the database separated into two parts: 
speech audios and video records in the data collecting process. Before the ex periment 
began the test of data qualities was creat ed and evaluated the expressive audio -visual 
perception first. The perception test designed to test the perception of a person if they 
received the real emotion expressed by the speakers in the data corpus  or not. The test 
separated into three parts; visua l data only, audio data only, and audio -visual data of the 
collected descriptive data, and tested all collected data by randomly ordered. The 
participants labeled the emotion after they watch or hear each data. All labels compared 
with the answer sheets.  The result showed as the figure 3.3.

Furthermore, the result from 30 Thai  native speakers  who are not in the database  shows 
that 97% can answer the  correct perception of audio -visual data. An average score of 
correctness perception for visual -only data is 87.84%, and the audio -only data is 83.80%. 
From 30 participants, all 30 persons can answe r more than 90% correctly, and nine 
persons can answer 100% correct in audio -visual data. Twelve person s can answer more 
than 90% correctly from all data as a result of visual -only data. Moreover, for the audio -
only data, there seven persons can answer mor e than 90% correctly.

3.3.2  Relationship between audio contour and features movement  
The evaluation o f this st udy was evaluate d by finding the relationship between facial 
expression and the speech sound caused by an emotion . One of the main objectives  of 
this study is to identify the effect of emotions on audio and visual data. We compare the 
signal acros s different emotion categories to identify whether there exists such differences 
in pitch and facial movement tracks . In the same emotion group, the rela tion of facial 
movement and pitch track should have the same pattern or value more than comparing to 
another emotion group.  
 
The relation between audio and visual data compared by using cross -correlation to find 
the value of data relative to two signal data. The cross -correlation calculated by using the 
correlate function in the Scipy library for signal pro cessing in Python programming.  As 
the signal data of speaking in sentence each feature ; F0, F1, F2, F3  contour s, or x-y 
position, has different  frequency even there are the time synchronized. However, the 
visual features signal cannot  be compare d directly with audio  contour s because of the 
frequency of data collection. In each syllable in a sentence was different time length. 
Then the first step is to normalize each feature based on a syllable data.  
 
According to that, one syllable dataset is selected the x positions, y positions, and F0 , 
Formants  data by 20 units of time. Next, dataset is selected to rescale data by using 
normalization equation defined as  (3.1) :  
 
 ùëç ùëñ= ùë•ùëñ ‚àí ùë•ÃÖ
ùë†   (3.1) 
 
Where: ùë•ùëñ is a data point, ùë•ÃÖ is the sample mean, and s is the sample standard deviation.  
 
After normaliz ing all dataset, the syllable dataset was selected and used the two features: 
F0, F1, F2, F3 data , x, or y  position, for calculating the correlation of them by using the 
cross -correlation z of arrays x and y  in Scipy.signal.correlation function which is the 
discreate linear cross -correlation of t he inputs  defined as  (3.2) : 
 
 ùëß[ùëò]=(ùë•√óùë¶)(ùëò‚àíùëÅ+1)= ‚àë ùë•ùëôùë¶ùëô‚àíùëò+ùëÅ‚àí1‚àó ||ùë•||‚àí1
ùë°=0  (3.2) 22 
 
for  ùëò = 0,1,...,||ùë•||+||ùë¶||‚àí2 
Where ||ùë•|| is the length of ùë•,ùëÅ=ùëöùëéùë• (||ùë•||,||ùë¶||) , and ùë¶ùëö is 0 when m is outside the 
range of y.  Finally, the output is an array contained a subset of the discreate lin ear 
cross -correlation of feature data 1 with feature data 2.  
 CHAPTER 4  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
This chapter is divide d into 3 sections for explanation of all the results and calculation on 
data to find the relation between the facial featur es and pitch tracks. First section is the 
visualization of collected data which plotted to show the changing in each sentence 
compare e ach emotion. The observation of movements reveal ed interesting  pattern s in 
each emotion, explained in Section 4.1. The s econd section explains  the calculati on of 
correlation among F0, x and y coordination at syllable level s. The correlation showed the 
relation of pitch track and x -y track, more detail in Section 4.2. The t hird section is the 
correlation of F0, x and y coordi nation compared in term of different emotions. The result 
show ed that F0 and x -y movements correlation of each person in the same emoti on group 
have high similarity than the different emotion group, discuss in 4.3.   
 
4.1   The Visualization of Data C ollect ed 
The collected data were separated into two parts, video records and audio records. Facial 
features were extracted as x -y coordination and tracked by using visual markers through 
the pronunciation. At the same time, acoustic data, particularly the fundam ental 
frequency (F0) was tr acked and synchronized with the facial data. The data from ten Thai 
native speakers were recorded as corpus for the study.  
 
All data grouped in sentences and emotion to study. One dataset plotted in three graphs 
as the figure 4.1  to figure 4.4, the figure shows the movement measuring of x -y 
coordination of 29 feature points collected from a person‚Äôs face in one sentence and the 
simulating curve of utterance. The first graph in each figure is the x -axis position from 
the facial rec ord which the higher value means the feature points moving to right side of 
a face otherwise is a left side. The second graph is the y -axis position from the facial 
record which the higher value means the feature points moving up toward otherwise is 
moving  down. And the third graph is F0 contour showing the pitch of the speech sound. 
The comparation is considered on a syllable level. Then separated into 4 emotions, there 
are neutral, happy, sad, and angry in order.  
 24 
The neutral expression, a one person spe aking a sentence without em otion or neutral face, 
is shown as an example in figure 4.1. From observation s, most of data showed the smooth 
movement of facial features with morphing along with the words sound. A face with no 
expression created the first move ment for this experiment an d the based speech sound for 
using to comparing with other emotions.  
 
The result of happy emotion, given an example as in figure 4.2, was visualized in a graph 
of one person speaking with happy emotion or smiling face. The happy expression data 
showed more  rapid changing in the x -axis and y -axis. The x -positions showed that the 
corners of mouth expanding and nostrils flaring out when speaking. In y -positions showed 
that mouth moving up profoundly and opening very large during the speaking and 
eyebrows shift  up to higher. The pitch curve came out in high level than the neutral face 
but almost same duration.  
 
The observation of sad emotion given in figure 4.3 one person speaking with sad emotion 
or pout face. The visualized data show s the slightly changing pos itions in the opposite of 
the happy expression, especially in the y -axis. There were not obviously changes in x -
position. In y -position, it was changing by middle lip moving up but corners of the mouth 
moving down during speaking . The center of eyebrows ra ised and contracted to the center 
of a forehead. The pitch curve showed in a lower pitch and long duration than in happy 
expression also the neutral expression.

The observation of speaking with anger emotion or tight face showed the extreme 
changed in the y-axis, but x -axis was not changing much, as an e xample in figure 4.4. 
The face of angry expression pulls the center of eyebrows lower, lips tightly closed, and 
nostrils move upward. While speaking, the y -position changing very fast and gain high 
value, es pecially the lower lip and chin. The pitch curve came out in lower level but 
straight nearly like the neutral face. Each syllable had shorter duration but much louder 
from the neutral.  
 
The observation of preprocess data, facial features movement related t o speech 
production. The speech acoustic features  differ in different movements of the feature 
points around the mouth. Then t he facial features can optimize from 29 x -y coordination 
to 15 feature points; there are P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6 for movement of a mouth, then P8, 
P10 for chin, next are P12, P13, P14, P15 for cheeks, and P25, P27, P29 for eyes and 
eyebrows movement.   
 
4.2  Audio -visual  Correlate s 
The relationship among F0 contour , formant frequencies , and X-Y position s were  studied 
by finding the cor relation of them. As the signal data of speaking in sentence each feature, 
F0 contour or x -y position, has different frequency even there are the synchronized. 
However, the visual features signal cannot  be compare d directly with audio  contour 
because of th e frequency of data collection. And in e ach syllable in a sentence was 
different time length. Then the first step is  to normalize each feature based on a syllable 
data.  
 
The correlation between two features: F0 and x -point, F0 and y -point, and x correlate d 
with y point, were  calculated 1 5 facia l features were selected as  representative x -y 
coordinates from 29 points. Then a sentence with 10 syllables were contained 110 facial 
features. And the correlation of F0 with x -y points were 330 results in total num ber. The 
correlation results of each syl lable showed as figure 4.5, the correlation of F0 with x -y 
points around a mouth in sentence 1 and neutral face. The correlation of the formant with 
x-point and y -point also calculated and the example of selected pos itions represented in 
figure 4.6 -4.7 30 
 
Correlation s were used for comparing the relationship between two signal data, if there 
are some related the value will raise up in otherwise if there are related in opposite way 
the value will fall less than 0. Figure  4.5 shows  the correlation result of 6 different x -y 
feature points  of a same person, the results raise or fall in middle of a graph. This median 
value stand for the relationship when two signals are fully overlapped together. Then the 
median value of corr elation results of these features used for comparing among syllables 
or persons or emotions as the correlate result of each syllable‚Äôs features.

31 
 
The comparation of each syl lable feature of one person data compared with the same 
syllable from 10 persons in neutral face. The result s are similar  to an example in figure 
4.5. In most facial feature points, P1 P6 P14 as an example, F0 signal were found to 
correlate with x and y mo vement in the positive correlation. However, there were s ome 
of the facial feature points,  for example  P5 in Fig.4.5,  F0 cor relate d with x and y 
movement in the negative correlation.  And s ome of them, for example  P16 in Fig.4.5 , the 
F0 correlate d with y bu t no relation with x movement or correlate opposite ly. There were 
rare to find no correlation among F0 with feature points, liked P3 in an example figure . 
The correlation value, the median of correlation result, of x -y are mostly  positive ly related 
to each  other.

Figure 4. 7 The correlation of formants with x -y position 5 in sentence 1 , neutral face  
 
As the result of formants correlation in figure 4.6-4.7, the co mparation of a syllable 
feature of one person data compared with the same syllable from 10 persons in neutral 
face. The results are like examples in figure 4.6 and 4.7. In some of  facial feature points 
are correlated in positive with the formants a s in fig ure 4.7. And the same feature points 
can either  correlate  in positive or negative with the different formants as in figure 4.6. 
 
33 
 
 
Figure 4. 8 The correlation of F0, and formants  with x -y points around a mouth in sentence 1   
and neutral face  
34 
Usually, the formants have correlation values similar to fundamental frequency, as shown 
in figure 4.8. The correlation of the first formant (F1) and the facial feature created the 
peaks in ne gative correlation compared with the positive correlation of x -y coordination . 
It means that the facial feature relative with formant frequency, the facial position has a 
great movement but low tone in audio frequency. The correlation value of the third 
formant (F3) and the facial feature is zero in some facial points, meaning that  the formant 
frequency does not correlate with the facial feature movement.   
 
4.3  The Emotion Effects as  The Difference in Sound and Facial‚Äôs 
Features  
4.3.1 E xperiment in the emotion effects of each person  
The comparation of each syllable feature of one  person data are compared in the same 
syllable showed the relation of facial features and pitch. In this section, the correlation 
values , represented the median  of correlation result  which is the calculated value when 
two data are completely collapse to ea ch other , used for finding the relation across an 
emotion group. The correlation of facial features with F0  in same syllable, same person 
but different emotion are compared as figure 4. 9, It shows the correlation among the 
syllable features compared the sa me word in neutral face, happy emotion, sad, and angry 
in order. A correlation  value in each sub -graph showed the different value.  
 35 
 
 
Figure 4. 9 The correlation of F0 with F0, x -y points at point 1 in sentence 1 compare in  
   4 emotions: neutral, happy,  sad, and angry  
 
The correlation result of F0 with x -y movement for one syllable showed as figure 4. 10. 
The value of each features compared across  the emotion groups. Blue color represents 
the positive correlation of facial feature and pitch, red color rep resents the negative 
correlation, and white color represents no relation among two signal features. The same 
syllable and same facial feature poin t have different correlation value.

Figure 4. 11 The correlation value of formants , x-y points in sentence 1 compare in  
  4 emotions: neutral, happy, sad, and angry  
 
The correlati on of F0 and x -y movement as in figure 4.10  (left)  the x positions 6, 8 are 
high correlate  in neutral, happy, and sad emotion. The y positions 6, 8, 10, 12 are in the 
same pattern, there are positive correlate in neutral, happy, but there is negative corre late 
in sad emotion. In x position 25, 27, 29, there strongly negative correlative in neutral, and 
happy  emotion. But there is positive correlation in angry emotion. From the correlation 
of F0 and facial movement shown that angry emotion is no relation tog ether, the 
correlation values are almost nearly zero in many facial features position.  
 
However, the correlation value s of formant frequencies and x -y movement in figure 4.11 
revealed that the angry emotion cause the strongly negative correlation in mostly  x-y 
positions in F1, F2, and F3. In the happy emotion, y -position have the great negative 
correlative with F2, F3.              
38

As a result, in figure 4.12, in the correlation of F0 and x -position 6, 8, 10 are negati ve 
correlation in neutral, happy, and angry emotion. In contrast, in the correlation of F0 and 
y-position 6, 8, 10 are positive relations in sad emotion. The correlation between F1 and 
x-position 1 -10 are a strongly negative correlation in neutral, but the y have a positive 
correlation in sad emotion. The correlation between F2 and y positi ons are negative in 
neutral and happy emotion. The correlation of F3 and x positions in sad emotions are 
positive relation to each other. However, the correlation of F3 an d y positions in happy 
emotions are opposite; they are negative relationship. The fig ure also showed that the 
formant frequencies have some similar pattern as the fundamental frequency.  
40 
The next experiment is the compar ation  mean contour of each features b y using cross -
correlation between one person to another person. Then compare across the emotion 
groups in the same syllable. The results showed the median data of correlation in the same 
emotion group and across emotion as in figures 4.13. 
 
4.3.2 Experimen t in the emotion effects of the same emotion group and across group  
The figure 4. 10-4.12 showed the correlation data of the frequency  contour compared with 
the same person and across person then compared the same emotion and across emotion. 
In figure 4.1 3, the correlation data of the x movement and y movement data calculat ed 
correlation values from mean contour. The comparation between a person with another 
person and across emotion group. The mean value of the same emotion group also higher 
than mean valu e from across emotion group.

The correlation value of  the persons in  the same emotion group has the similar  value  than 
correlation value from across emotion group  as showed in figures 4.14 ‚Äì 4.18.  The 
correlation of each person‚Äôs pitch is comparable in the same group. The correlation of y 
movement of each person showed the similarity in the same group, there are posi tive and 
negative correlation than outside emotion group.  The   1st formant     correlation value in 
figure 4.17 reve aled that the   emotion can relative to other emotion and the same group 
of emotion ha s the highly correlation more than in  another  group. The 2nd formant 
correlation value as figure 4.18 has    the   high relative value in the same emotion group. 
And  the   neutral emotion have highly correlation value compared to other emotion.
CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSION  
 
In this chapter, all processes of the stud y provided from the objectives, experimental 
design, data collection, results, discussions, and conclusion. As the hy pothesis of this 
study, an emotion or facial expression affect pitch track and facial feature movement.  
 
The experimental design to find th e relation of the visual and audio parts is to calculate 
the correlation value of facial features and pitch signals. The experiment using the 
collected the relevant stimuli consist of 4 facial expressions and 4 Thai sentences, in a 
total of 16 combinations . The expressions produced by 10 Thai native speakers (five 
males and five females) were selected. All speakers prono unced four sentences of 10 
syllables.  The speakers prepared before expressing each sentence as the plan.  In total, 
there are 160 emotional, expressive utterances and visual tracks.  The data corpus 
evaluated the perception test by 30 participants and got 97% can answer the  correct  
emotion  of audio -visual data , 87.84%  of people can answer visual -only data  correctly , 
and for the audio -only data is 83.80%  of overall .   
 
Then all data collected are visualized to observe some similarity of the movement of 
facial features changes along each utterance simulates by  fundamental frequency or  F0 
and the formant frequenci es; F1, F2, F3.  As the data visualizing, Happy and sad 
expressions show the most difference. Happy facial expression moves the mouth's corners 
up and ma kes a larger mouth gesture than the sad facial expression. The sound is more 
precise, louder, and create  a higher frequency sound than neutral and sad. The sad face 
expression has a lower mouth's corners. Then it can open in a small cavity. The speech 
come s out in lower frequency and longer duration to make a clear word. Anger facial 
expression shows the tig ht muscles around a mouth, which cause a short duration, lower 
pitch. However, anger expression has a louder sound than other expressions.  
 
One syllable  is image and sound synchronously ‚Äîthe relation of facial features and sound 
signals. The signal analysis  in section 4.2 shows the related relation of F0 and facial 
features in x y movements. The movement of facial features in the y -axis usually found 
more relative to F0 than the movement in the x -axis. The formants frequency correlated 
with the facial featur e has a correlation value similar to the fundamental frequency. 47 
According to the results in section 4.3, the relation of the facial features and pitch t rack 
or formants in each syllable, a significant expression effect of the correlation value in 
each pers on‚Äôs features showed a pattern.  The correlation of formants and x -y positions 
also showed that the audio frequency is not relative with x -y movement som etimes in 
angry emotion.  In the result of angry emotion revealed that Thai expression normally 
used the sound tone and expressed a little change on face.  Moreover, for the correlation 
value  experiment across the emotion groups of the group of people,  the s ame emotion 
group has highly correlated than outside groups .  
 
In conclusion, the different emotions cau se different changes in the movement of facial 
features and different in pitch track relatively. Furthermore , the movement of facial 
features is related  to the pitch track  and formants . The changing of facial features in the 
y-axis shows the related to pit ch track than in the x -axis. And the formants revealed the 
pattern of each emotions which relative to x and y movements.  Finally, the movement of 
the fa cial features  which caused by expression  affect ed speech production. The acoustic 
features differ in dif ferent movements of the feature points around the mouth.  
 
However, the study of emotion relationship and facial movement effect on speech 
production nee ds more study on the length and amplitude of the audio features, which 
may be affected by the expression  or not. Thai audio -visual corpus also needs more 
improvement for use in other purposes. The synthesis of facial features' movement in a 
syllable by usi ng target approximation knowledge is another purpose to work on in the 
future. This study is just a begi n of more knowledge of Thai expression, speech 
production, and expression synthesis.
