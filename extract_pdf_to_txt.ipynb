Prof. Dr. Khajonpong Akkarajitsakul Program  Master of Engineering Field of Study Computer Engineering Department Computer Engineering Faculty Engineering Academic Year 2021  Abstract  Resource estimation is a technique that has many uses. In this research, we examine how it can be used to estimate computing resources of systems based on historical data in order to make them more efficient. Many researchers have applied machine learning to estimate computing resources. The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) is currently developing a new logging system for A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) detector based on the Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) software stack. Beats, a shipper installed on the First Level Processor nodes, will receive the logged data and transfer it to Logstash, a data preprocessing pipeline. Logstash ingests the data and sends the ingested data to Elasticsearch which is used for search and analytics. The system faces difficult problems when working with large clusters which are hard to estimate. Moreover, in the future, the number of nodes and the number of services in the machine can increase or decrease. Resource estimation was used to estimate and plan the number of resources by using Metricbeat to get the historical computing metrics of machines and by using Logstash to make the system more reliable and adaptable to changes. We applied different machine learning algorithms including Random Forest Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron to create models. The efficiency of these models is measured and compared using the coefficients of determination which are Mean Absolute Error and Mean Square Error.

Once an optimization function has been defined, Hyperparameter Tuning would sequentially consider many sets of values that define the hyperparameters for the machine learning models and select most optimal set. The process is difficult and time-consuming. As such, Automated Hyperparameter Tuning has been suggested to expedite the process and two well-known traditional parameter optimization methods are grid search and random search. However, these methods are computationally expensive for a large amount of hyperparamters. Furthermore, these methods only sequentially analyze through predefined sets of hyperparameters without the ability to reactively adjust the values toward an optimal solution. In this thesis, the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm was adopted to automatically adjust hyperparameters. ABC is a metaheuristic method based on bee foraging behavior. Execution time, accuracy, F1-score, and accuracy plus F1-score of using ABC were chosen as performance indicators for the comparison of different hyperparameter tuning techniques for different classification algorithms against those from grid search and random search.

Prof. Santitham Prom-on, Ph.D. Assoc. Prof. Orawan Duangphakdee Ph.D. Program  Master of Engineering Field of Study  Computer Engineering Department  Computer Engineering Faculty  Engineering Academic Year 2020  Abstract  The honeybee is a social insect that communicates with its nestmates when engaging in its various activities. Honeybees normally emit signaling sounds to communicate information such as flight orientation, the dance circuit of recruited bees and hissing in response to disturbances. As a result, beehives have been monitored in numerous studies to gather audio data in order to classify the potential status of the beehive. This study demonstrates the technique of a classification model for hissing behavior in Asian cavity-nesting bees, Apis cerana, under different circumstances. The monitoring devices were installed to collect hissing signals related to their defensive behavior. A number of feature extraction techniques in the audio processing were explored, including short-time energy, spectral transformation, Mel filter banks, and Mel spectrograms. Moreover, both the traditional and deep learning-based classification models were tested including the support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, and convolutional neural networks. The best model was selected based on two competing objectives: the minimum number of parameters and 95% baseline accuracy. The results revealed that the one-dimensional neural network trained with the temporal domain spectrogram that consists of 2 hidden layers, 32 nodes for each layer, and a minimum of 3,737 trainable parameters could provide the best accuracy.
