Abstract   
Since the spread of Coronavirus disease or Covid-19 at the end of 2019,
there has been an extensive amount of news about Covid-19,
and it takes a long time for humans to read the news,
process it and retrieve important information from it. 
Therefore, automatic text summarization is necessary in this matter 
as it can help us process information faster and use it to make 
better decisions. Currently, there are two main approaches to 
automatic text summarization: extractive and abstractive. 
Extractive text summarization is conducted by identifying important 
parts of the text and extracting a subset of sentences from the 
original text. Abstractive text summarization is closer to the human 
method as it is the reproduction or rephrasing based on interpretation 
and understanding of the text using natural language processing 
techniques. In this research, we applied an abstractive summarization 
method on a specific dataset, namely, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) 
news dataset about Covid-19 news. Data augmentation was also exploited 
in the pre-processing part to be an example case of working with data 
that are not perfect or diverse enough. Two Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) 
models, with and without data augmentation, were used to generate summaries. 
The resulting summaries were analyzed and compared with related work using 
Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metrics.
