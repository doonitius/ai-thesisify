An Analysis on Network and Topology of Legal Documents Using Text Mining and Graph Approach
The number of documents in a dataset available on the Internet is increasing. 
However, the limitation of using textual information derived from documents in data analysis requires more computation time and resources as the data grow. 
An analysis of the documents in a dataset can be conducted using other types of features. 
This thesis presented a computational study on documents with references. 
The analysis chose Thai legal documents as a dataset. 
The data were collected from an information service system of the Supreme Court of Thailandâ€™s website. 
The study utilized text mining and network analysis to gain insight from the corpus. 
The analysis method included connected component analysis, graph clustering, and induced graphs. 
The study also built an information retrieval system from the network features obtained from the network analysis. 
The evaluation revealed an increase in the performance after incorporating the network features with textual features. 
This indicated the potential benefit of using network features in a real-world information retrieval system.
