The honeybee is a social insect that communicates with its nestmates when engaging in its various activities. 
Honeybees normally emit signaling sounds to communicate information such as flight orientation, 
the dance circuit of recruited bees and hissing in response to disturbances. As a result, 
beehives have been monitored in numerous studies to gather audio data in order to classify the potential status of the beehive. 
This study demonstrates the technique of a classification model for hissing behavior in Asian cavity-nesting bees, Apis cerana, 
under different circumstances. The monitoring devices were installed to collect hissing signals related to their defensive behavior. 
A number of feature extraction techniques in the audio processing were explored, including short-time energy, spectral transformation, 
Mel filter banks, and Mel spectrograms. Moreover, both the traditional and deep learning-based classification models were 
tested including the support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, and convolutional neural networks. The best model was 
selected based on two competing objectives: the minimum number of parameters and 95% baseline accuracy. The results 
revealed that the one-dimensional neural network trained with the temporal domain spectrogram that consists of 2 hidden 
layers, 32 nodes for each layer, and a minimum of 3,737 trainable parameters could provide the best accuracy.
