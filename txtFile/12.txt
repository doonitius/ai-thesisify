Abstract  
This thesis  presents a computational study on the relation between the movement of visual 
facial and acoustic features. Audio -visual corpus on expressive speech production was 
collected for the study. For the corpus, the relevant stimuli consist ed of 4 fac ial 
expression s and 4 Thai sentences, thus in total , there are  16 combinations. Video and 
audio data were captured from 10 native Thai speakers. Each speaker pronounce d the 
sentence of all combinations in the stimuli . In total, there were  160 audi o-visual track s 
for the analysis. Facial features were extracted and tracked by using visual markers 
through the pronunciation. At the same time, acoustic data, particularly the fundamental 
frequency (F0) was tracked and synchronized with the facial data. Computati onal analysis 
on the landmark and dynamic features of both visual and audio data were performed. This 
result provides the relation  of the expressive facial movement together with the acoustic 
adjustments.
