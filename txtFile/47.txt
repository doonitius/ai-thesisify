NON-GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE DATA DISSEMINATION ON VEHICULAR AD HOC NETWORKS
Reliable broadcasting in vehicular ad hoc networks is challenging due to its unique characteristics including intermittent connectivity and various vehicular scenarios. 
Applications and services in intelligent transportation systems need an efficient, fast and reliable broadcasting protocol. 
We propose a non-geographical knowledge reliable broadcasting protocol that has an efficient data forwarder selection and an efficient broadcasting mechanism. 
The forwarder node selection algorithm is a self-decision algorithm that lets a node to know that it belongs to a member of connected dominating set or not. 
The algorithm is a combination of density-based algorithm and topology-based algorithm, called “DTA”. 
The algorithm does not require any geographical knowledge. 
Therefore, it can avoid violating a privacy issue. 
Moreover, the algorithm can resist inaccurate data than position base algorithms that need high frequent beaconing for accurate data. 
We also propose a new broadcasting protocol, called “NoG”. 
NoG consists of a broadcasting mechanism, a waiting timeout mechanism and a beaconing mechanism. 
The proposed protocol operates without any geographical knowledge and provides reliable and efficient data dissemination. 
The performance is evaluated with a realistic network simulator (NS-3). 
Simulation results show that NoG with DTA outperforms other existing protocols in terms of reliability, overhead, and data dissemination speed.
