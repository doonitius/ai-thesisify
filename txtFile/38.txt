MULTI-DOMAIN NETWORK DESIGN STRATEGY FOR SURVIVABLE LARGE-SCALE OPTICAL NETWORKS
This thesis addresses two main issues of survivable multi-domain large-scale optical networks, namely domain privacy and scalability. 
In principle, the physical network topology of each domain can be hidden from other domains by using an aggregation model to form a network of virtual domains, thereby satisfying domain privacy requirement. 
First, we develop an improved aggregation model for p-cycle protection that ensures full protection against all single link failures and is more efficient than existing models. 
To optimize for the spare capacity requirement, Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations are derived. 
Second, we propose a new approach for multi-domain network design using shared-mesh protection where the backup capacity of intra-domain and inter-domain links can be shared more effectively. 
The proposed approach also provides a three-step systematic design and optimization, which allows our proposed ILP formulation to resolve larger network problems compared to single-domain network design approach. 
Several practical network design examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique with respect to spare capacity requirement and network latency.
