Resilient heat exchanger network design of hydrodealkylation process
Energy recovery by heat exchanger network is the important stage in chemical process. 
The energy integration causes to the interactions and may cause the process more difficult to maintain the target temperature. 
Therefore, in order to achieve maximum energy recovery and keep target temperatures at their desirable value, the resilient heat exchanger network that can tolerate variations are important. 
This research, the resilient heat exchanger network design procedure provided by Wongsri (1990) is use to design resilient network for the Hydrodealkylation process (HDA Process) in Class I problem. 
The match pattern heuristic, shift approach and the heat load propagation technique are essential approach. 
Six alternatives for the HDA process are redesign to be the resiliency networks for maintain target temperature and also reached maximum energy recovery (MER). 
The Resiliency Parameters of resilient networks are required to compare and selected the best resilient network. 
In order to receive resilient network, a trade-off between cost and resiliency may be needed. 
The Auxiliary unit should be added in the network for cope safely with the variations and easy to design control structure to the network.
