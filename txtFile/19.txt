Stock Market Movement Prediction Using Enhanced Deep Learning Model with Numerical and Textual Information
Stock market prediction is difficult because markets are volatile and influenced by many factors. Recently, many studies attempt to predict stock market trend using deep learning approach. 
These prediction models employed two types of input as (1) numerical information of historical prices and technical indicators, and (2) textual information including news contents or headlines. 
However, most of the studies focused on prediction model development based on a single input type, while investors analyzed market behavior based on a variety of information. 
In this work, we proposed a deep neural network for stock market prediction, which can analyze both types of inputs. 
The proposed model consists of convolutional neural network and long-short term memory and takes event embedding vectors extracted from news headlines, historical price data, and a set of technical indicators as input. 
Moreover, we also introduced a new objective function that can improve annualized return based on trading simulations by using Sharpe ratio, which is a measure of return relative to risk, and Cross-entropy.
