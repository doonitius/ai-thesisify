System logs contain the complete information of service operations which is usually 
written by developers. In recent years, anomaly detection on log messages is popular. 
Several researchers applied the machine learning techniques to the system logs to detect 
the anomalous behaviors of the system. At the same time, CERN organization planned to 
establish a new data center in 2020 to improve the performance of the system. According 
to the new datacenter, ALICE intends to build a monitoring system for the new system. 
However, ALICE has been deploying the conventional monitoring system but requires 
the intervention of administrators. In this work, a novel anomaly detection framework is 
proposed by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) along with Transformer which 
is popular in machine translation tasks. The proposed framework automatically monitors 
the service operation logs and detects the anomalous events based on the log messages. 
The dataset used in the work is HDFS operation logs. To evaluate the model, the 
measurement metrics include Precision, Recall, F-measure, Miss detection rate, and False 
alarm rate. Finally, we design the experiments to compare the performance against the 
existing works which use LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory)-based and CNN-based 
approaches.
