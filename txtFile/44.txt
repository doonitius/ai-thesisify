Identifying non-binding constrints in linear programming problems using supervised learning neural networks
This thesis proposed an approach for identifying non-binding constraints in a linear programming problem (LP). 
A supervised learning neural network 9NN) was applied in the prediction method. 
The inputs of neural network were composed of the coefficients of the objective function, the coefficients of the constraints and the right-hand-side constants of linear programming problems. 
For each target of neural network, it set to 1 fif the constraint was binding and O if the constraint was non-binding. 
We considered specifically the LP that has a unique optimal solution and fixed the problem size to m x n dimensions where n was varied from 2 to 4 and m was varied from n to n+2. 
Moreover, the back propagation (BP) algorithm was selected for training neural networks. 
The result of this research showed the accuracy of neural networks that identified non-binding constraint.
