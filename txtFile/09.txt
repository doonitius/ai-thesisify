Understanding and interpretation of legislative corpus has problems 
related to unclear entity actions and coreference. Coreference is a 
linguistic expression in the corpus that refers to the same object, 
and entity's activities represent semantic meaning on what has been 
done to whom. This research addresses coreference resolution and 
meaning representation in legislative corpora using an integrated 
algorithm including Span Bidirectional Encoder Representation 
Transformer (SpanBERT) for coreference resolution and Abstract Meaning 
Representation (AMR) for meaning representation. Five-step frameworks 
are conducted: legal text preprocessing, coreference resolution, AMR, 
evaluation for meaning preservation, and complexity reduction. Smatch 
evaluation tool and Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) scores were 
applied to evaluate overlapped meaning between resolved and unresolved 
coreference sentences. The AMR performance was evaluated by Smatch score 
with 12 experiments conducted on AMR nodes. Convention on the Right of 
the Child (CRC), Convention on the Rights of the Person with Disabilities (CRPD), 
and Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of the Refugees (CPRSR) 
were the datasets. This experiment shows the SpanBERT algorithm's generalization 
for coreference resolution in the legal area with 72.08%, 78.03%, and 69.19% 
in CRC, CRPD, and CPRSR respectively. The ambiguity reduction shows the AMR 
semantic conversion, meaning preservation, and node fluctuation. The AMR nodes 
are fluctuated according to the complexity of coreference. When applying SpanBERT 
with AMR parsing, the legal text is simplified, and AMR is a potential tool to
perform legal text meaning representation. The AMR graphs after complexity being reduced 
can be applied for further legal text processing tasks with Neural Network such as legal 
inferencing.
