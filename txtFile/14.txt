Quantum Random Walk on A Number Line Implementation on Different Simulators with Wall-Time Benchmarking
Since a classical computer has a limitation to solve a large size of data and complex problems, researchers have be en trying to find new solutions. 
Quantum computing is one of them. 
A number of quantum algorithms have been invented. 
Some of them were theoretically proved that they could solve problems faster than their classical versions. 
According to the literature review, a quantum random walk has various advantages. 
Moreover, it can be a tool to construct other quantum algorithms. 
In this thesis, the one-dimensional quantum random walk is studied.
Then, the quantum random walk circuit is implemented. 
Forest from Rigetti and Qiskit from IBM, which are quantum programming platforms, are explored. 
Two experiments are conducted. 
First, the circuits are examined on quantum computer simulators from IBM and Rigetti. 
The sizes of the circuits are 4, 5, 6, and 7-qubits position states. 
For each size, the circuit is constructed with 5 different types of shift operators. 
The results show that computing wall-time from IBM’s quantum computer simulator is significantly lower than Rigetti’s quantum computer simulator for the same size and circuit type. 
Moreover, on the same circuit type, a positive linear relationship between the computing wall-time and the circuit depth is presented. 
Second, the same circuit sizes and types from the first experiment were deployed on an actual IBM quantum computer, named ibmq_16_melbourne. 
However, the returned result is only for the 4-qubit position state. 
The other sizes of position states return error due to the capacity of the quantum computer. 
Furthermore, the returned measurement results are disturbed by the noise from the operation of the actual quantum computer.
