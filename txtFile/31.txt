Network management policy for overlapping between cabling and wireless networks in medicare system
When the network utilization increased, congestion and delay problems occurred. 
Then, the network cannot properly serve needs of users. 
Since the Medicare system has significant applications transmitted within the system, these problems can be critically serious in some emergency cases. 
Consequently, Overlap-network with policies model was proposed in this Thesis. 
The results have shown that with the appropriate management of transmitted applications through a network policy as well as determining of resource allocation by installing a wireless network over the original wired network can efficiently enhance performance by relieving the congestion and delay problems. 
Therefore, this research has successfully proved that Overlap-network with policies is the efficient solution with cost-effectiveness on the network management policy for the Medicare system.
