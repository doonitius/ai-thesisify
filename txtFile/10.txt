Abstract  
Word segmentation is an important pre-processing step in natural language processing 
applications, particularly in languages with no demarcation indicators including such as 
Thai. Dictionary-based segmentation, while simple, does not consider the context of the 
sentence. This paper proposes an attention-based deep learning approach for Thai word 
segmentation. With an additional attention mechanism, the model can learn character 
correlations across the entire sentence without gradient vanishing or gradient explode 
problems and then tokenize them into word vectors. The goal of this research is to test 
two different types of attention mechanisms to determine the effectiveness of word 
tokenization. The visualization of attention for each attention mechanism is also included 
as an outcome.
