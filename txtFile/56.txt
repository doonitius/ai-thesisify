Quantum circuits for shor’s algorithm
The prime factorization algorithm by Peter Shor is one of the most famous algorithms for quantum computers. 
The goal of this thesis is to study the behavior of Shor’s algorithm and design quantum circuits to run it on existing quantum computers. 
The proposed quantum circuits are developed from the circuit by Stephane Beauregard. 
The experiment is done on IBM 15 qubits quantum computer.
