Abstract  
The number of documents in a dataset available on the Internet is increasing. However, 
the limitation of using textual information derived from documents in data analysis 
requires more computation time and resources as the data grow. An analysis of the 
documents in a dataset can be conducted using other types of features. This thesis 
presented a computational study on documents with references. The analysis chose Thai legal documents as a dataset. The data were collected from an information service system 
of the Supreme Court of Thailandâ€™s website. The study utilized text mining and network 
analysis to gain insight from the corpus. The analysis method included connected component analysis, graph clustering, and induced graphs. The study also built an 
informatio n retrieval system from the network features obtained from the network 
analysis. The evaluation revealed an increase in the performance after incorporating the network features with textual features. This indicated the potential benefit of using 
network fe atures in a real -world information retrieval system.
