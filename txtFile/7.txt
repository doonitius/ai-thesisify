Abstract   
In recent studies, many NLP tasks could gain better performance by applying the word 
embedding as the representation of words. In this research , we propose Deep Word -Topic 
Latent Dirichlet  Allocation  (DWT -LDA), a ne w process for training LDA with word  
embedding. DWT -LDA  augment s the samp ling process of an original LDA by 
incorporating  word embedding  technique  to allow the model to capture topics based  
embedding.  A neural network is applied  to the Collapsed Gibbs Sampling process as 
another choice for  word topic assignment.  A dataset crawled from Panti p.com  and 
Amazon Customer Review . To quantitatively evaluate our model, the  topic coherence 
framework , topic diversity , and topic quality  were  used to compare between  our approach 
and LDA.  The experimental result on both Thai and English dataset indicate  that DWT -
LDA  performs better than LDA on both datasets.
