Log Data Traffic Characterization for Packet Loss Estimation in ALICE O2  System
Loss estimation is considerably significant for network planning processes and plays a main role in bandwid th allocation optimization, network design, guaranteeing quality of service (QoS), etc. 
According to The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the ALICE O2 computing system has nodes, called First Level Processors (FLPs), which collect particl e interaction data from ALICE detectors and carry out local processing. 
Log data generated by tasks running on FLPs are sent over a network to the Logstash. 
The log is then filtered and sent to the Elasticsearch and Kibana for future anomaly detection. 
Large amounts of log-data traffic from FLPs over this network could lead to packet loss. 
In this research, we create FLPs in a testbed environment to characterize the log-data traffic generated by tasks in FLPs and fit the data to time-series models and probability distributions assuming independent interarrival times. 
The fitted models are then used to study end-to-end packet loss with input traffic from a large number of FLPs in a network of switches. 
The simulation results can help predict the number of FLP s and traffic intensity that the network can sustain for different kinds of tasks running on FLPs. 
Lastly, in order to find the best represented model compared to the real trace result, we performed model verification and took into account the end-to-end packet loss and queue utilization of each task.
